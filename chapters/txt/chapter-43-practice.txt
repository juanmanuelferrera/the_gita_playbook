Chapter 43: Practice

Day One

Journal Entry: Monday, January 3rd

Starting meditation today. Everyone says it changes your life. We'll see.

Goal: 20 minutes every morning.

Sat for 4 minutes. Legs hurt. Mind wouldn't stop. This is supposed to help?

---

Thomas closes the journal. Four minutes. Pathetic.

But it's something.

He's read the books. The Gita. The Buddhist texts. The modern mindfulness stuff. They all say the same thing: practice.

But what they don't say -- what he's discovering the hard way -- is that practice isn't dramatic. It's not Instagram-worthy.

It's just showing up. Again. And again. And again. Even when nothing happens.

Journal Entry: Friday, January 7th

Day 5. Sat for 6 minutes before my brain started screaming. Progress?

Journal Entry: Monday, January 17th

Missed three days. Convincing myself it doesn't matter. But it does. Starting again.

Journal Entry: Sunday, February 6th

One month in. Still feel like I'm doing it wrong. But doing it anyway.

Sat for 12 minutes today. Didn't fall asleep. Didn't quit early. Just... sat.

Is this it? Is this all there is?

Reflective Bridge

Practice isn't an event. It's architecture.

You don't build a house by staring at blueprints. You lay one brick. Then another. Then another.

Most days, you can't see the house taking shape. You just see bricks. Mud. Exhaustion.

Thomas wants transformation. But transformation doesn't announce itself. It accumulates -- silently, stubbornly, one repetition at a time.

And the hardest truth? The mind will resist. Every time. Not because practice is wrong, but because the mind fears what it cannot control.

The Gita Speaks: The Ladder of Practice

Krishna doesn't promise Arjuna instant transformation. He acknowledges, with surprising directness, that the mind is wild -- and then offers a staircase for those willing to climb.

  "O mighty-armed son of Kunti, it is undoubtedly very difficult to curb the restless mind, but it is possible by constant practice and by detachment."

  -- Bhagavad-gita 6.35

Very difficult. Krishna doesn't sugarcoat it. The restless mind is a real adversary.

But it is possible. Not easy. Possible. And only through two instruments: constant practice and detachment from results.

Thomas wants calm. But calm isn't the goal. Practice is the goal. Detachment from whether today's session "worked" -- that's the discipline.

Then Krishna offers something remarkable: a graduated path. Not everyone can fix the mind in pure meditation. So He provides steps.

  "Just fix your mind on Me, the Supreme Personality of God, and engage all your intelligence in Me. Thus, you will always live with Me without any doubt."

  -- Bhagavad-gita 12.8

Fix your mind on Me. The highest step. Total absorption. If you can do this, nothing else is needed.

But what if you can't?

  "My dear Arjuna, O conqueror of wealth, if you cannot fix your mind on Me without deviation, then follow the regulative principles of bhakti-yoga. In this way, cultivate the desire to reach Me."

  -- Bhagavad-gita 12.9

Follow the regulative principles. Structure. Routine. Scheduled practice. If spontaneous absorption is beyond you, use discipline as your scaffolding.

And if even that feels too demanding?

  "If you cannot practice the regulations of bhakti-yoga, then simply try to work for Me, for by working in this way, you will come to the perfect stage."

  -- Bhagavad-gita 12.10

Simply try to work for Me. Dedicate your daily labor. Your job. Your errands. Your responsibilities. Offer them as service. That, too, is practice.

And if even that is too much?

  "However, if you are unable to work with that consciousness of Me, then try to act by renouncing all results of your work and try to situate yourself in the self."

  -- Bhagavad-gita 12.11

Renouncing all results. Just let go of outcomes. Stop clinging to success or failure. Act, and release.

This is the genius of the Gita's approach to practice: there is no excuse. Wherever you are, there is a step you can take. The staircase meets you where you stand.

Living the Teaching

Journal Entry: Monday, March 14th

Something shifted this morning. Can't explain it.

Not enlightenment. Not bliss. Just... quiet.

I sat for 20 minutes and it didn't feel like work. It felt like coming home.

Then I stood up and it was gone.

But for those 20 minutes? I got it. I understood why people do this.

---

Thomas keeps practicing. Not because every session is transcendent. Most aren't.

But he's learning to apply Krishna's staircase.

On good days, his mind settles. He feels absorbed. Present.

On bad days, he can't focus at all. So he follows the structure -- same time, same place, same posture. The regulative principles carry him when inspiration won't.

On the worst days, he skips the cushion entirely. But he dedicates his work -- the spreadsheets, the emails, the commute -- as an offering. Not perfectly. Just intentionally.

And on the days when even that feels impossible, he simply lets go of results. He doesn't measure whether the day was "spiritual." He just lives it. And releases.

The staircase holds him wherever he falls.

Practice Box

The Staircase of Practice

1. Start where you are. Don't aim for the top step. If meditation feels impossible, dedicate your work. If that's too much, just let go of results. Find your step.

2. Same time, same place. Your mind needs cues. Make it automatic. Morning. Same chair. Same ritual. Remove decisions.

3. When you slip, descend one step. Can't meditate today? Follow the routine. Can't follow routine? Dedicate your work. Can't even do that? Just release outcomes. There's always a step.

4. Expect nothing. Receive everything. The days you expect transcendence, you'll get distraction. Stop demanding results. Practice is its own reward.

Journal Entry: Sunday, June 5th

Six months. Haven't missed more than two days in a row.

Not because I'm disciplined. Because the staircase holds me. Some days I'm at the top. Some days I'm barely hanging on to the bottom step.

But I'm always on the staircase.

Journal Entry: Monday, December 31st

One year.

I'm not enlightened. I'm not transformed in any way I can explain.

But I'm more myself than I was.

The practice didn't change me. It revealed me.

Brick by brick. Day by day.

And when I look back, there's a house. Not the house I imagined. But a house that's mine.

The Way Forward

Two years later, Thomas still sits every morning.

A friend asks him, "When did it start working?"

Thomas thinks about it.

"It was always working," he says. "I just couldn't see it. Because I was looking for the house while I was laying bricks."

"So when did you see the house?"

"When I stopped looking for it. When I just... kept laying bricks."

The friend frowns. "That doesn't make sense."

"It doesn't," Thomas agrees. "Until it does."

Because practice isn't logical. It's not strategic. It's not efficient.

It's consistent action, aligned with your intention, repeated until the repetition itself becomes the transformation.

And the Gita's gift is this: wherever you are, there's a step for you. You're never too far gone, too distracted, too busy, too broken to practice.

The staircase meets you where you stand.

Just take the next step.

Reflection

- Where are you on Krishna's staircase? Can you fix your mind in meditation, or do you need the structure of routine? Or would dedicating your daily work be a more honest starting point?
- What practice have you abandoned because it didn't produce immediate results? What if the practice itself -- not the outcome -- was the point?
- Can you commit to one step a day? Not the top. Just one step. Every day. For a month. What would that look like for you?
