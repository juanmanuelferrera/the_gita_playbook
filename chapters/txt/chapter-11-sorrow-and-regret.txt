Chapter 11: Sorrow and Regret

The Unchangeable Past

Daniel's father died on a Tuesday.

Heart attack. Sudden. No warning. No chance to say goodbye.

But that's not what haunts Daniel three years later.

What haunts him is the argument they had the week before. Over something stupid--politics, maybe, or Daniel's career choices, one of those recurring battles they'd been having for twenty years. Daniel had hung up mid-sentence. Didn't call back.

Was planning to. Eventually. When he cooled down. When his father cooled down.

But eventually never came.

Now Daniel sits in the same kitchen where they used to argue, going through his father's things, and the regret is physical. Heavy. It presses on his chest, makes it hard to breathe, turns ordinary objects into accusations.

If only I'd called back.

If only I'd been less defensive.

If only I'd said I loved him before hanging up.

If only I'd known.

But he didn't know. And he didn't call. And now his father is gone and the past is unchangeable and Daniel is left with this: a sorrow that never softens and a regret that offers no resolution.

"You can't change what happened," his therapist tells him.

Daniel knows that. Intellectually. But knowing doesn't help. Because the past isn't just behind him. It's in him. Alive. Present. Replaying on an endless loop. And every replay ends the same way: with the thing he can never fix.

He finds his father's reading glasses on the kitchen counter. Still there. Three years later, still there, because his mother can't bring herself to move them. Daniel picks them up. The lenses are smudged. His father never cleaned his glasses properly. Daniel used to tease him about it.

He puts them down. Sits at the table. And the loop begins again.

Making Peace With What Cannot Be Changed

Regret is a strange torment.

Unlike fear, which points to the future, or anger, which demands action, regret focuses entirely on the past. On what you did or didn't do. On choices you can't unmake.

And the cruel paradox: the more you regret something, the more impossible it becomes to change it. You replay the moment constantly--not to understand it, but to fix it. To go back and choose differently.

But you can't. The past is fixed. Immutable. Beyond your reach.

And so regret becomes its own kind of prison. You're free to act in the present, but you're emotionally chained to a moment that no longer exists except in memory.

The Bhagavad-gita doesn't tell you to simply "let it go" or "forgive yourself." Instead, it points to something deeper: your relationship with impermanence itself. What if sorrow, though real, is not the final word? What if the wise relate to loss differently--not because they feel less, but because they understand more?

The Gita Speaks: The Wisdom Beyond Sorrow

Krishna opens his entire teaching with a statement about sorrow and regret. It is the very first thing he says to Arjuna after listening to his grief:

    "The Supreme Personality of God said: While you speak with cultured words, you lament over what is not worthy of lament. Those who are wise do not lament for the living or the dead."

    -- Bhagavad-gita 2.11

This verse is often misread as cold--as if Krishna is telling Arjuna to stop feeling. But look more carefully. He doesn't say "don't feel." He says the wise do not lament--meaning their understanding transforms their relationship to loss. They still love. They still lose. But they don't remain imprisoned by the loss, because they understand something about the nature of reality that sorrow obscures.

What do they understand? Krishna continues:

    "For one who has taken his birth, death is certain; and for one who is dead, birth is certain. Therefore, in the unavoidable discharge of your duty, you should not lament."

    -- Bhagavad-gita 2.27

Birth and death are certain. Not possible. Not likely. Certain. This is the nature of embodied existence: everything that begins will end. Every relationship, every body, every moment is temporary. Sorrow arises when we collide with this truth--when we expected permanence and received impermanence instead.

Daniel expected more time with his father. He expected another chance to call back. He expected the relationship to continue. And when it didn't--when impermanence arrived without warning--sorrow flooded in.

But Krishna says: lament is not worthy of the wise. Not because the loss isn't real, but because the wise understand that impermanence is not a tragedy. It is the nature of material existence. Fighting it is like fighting gravity. You don't have to like it. But resisting what is certain only adds suffering to loss.

Then Krishna describes the person who has integrated this understanding:

    "A person who neither rejoices upon achieving something pleasant nor laments upon receiving something unpleasant, who is wise in relation to being, not confused, and who understands the science of God, is already situated in transcendence."

    -- Bhagavad-gita 5.20

Neither rejoicing nor lamenting. This is not emotional numbness. It is equanimity--the capacity to receive both pleasant and unpleasant experiences without being destroyed by either. The wise person feels the loss. But they are not confused by it. They understand being itself. They know that the self which experiences sorrow is eternal, and that the circumstances which cause sorrow are temporary.

And finally, the destination of this understanding:

    "One who is thus transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman. He never laments nor desires to have anything; he is equally disposed to every living entity. In that state he attains pure devotional service unto Me."

    -- Bhagavad-gita 18.54

He never laments. Not because he never loved. Not because he avoided attachment. But because he has realized something so profound about the nature of reality that sorrow, while it may arise, cannot hold him. He is equally disposed to every living entity--those present and those gone, those who treated him well and those who didn't. This is not indifference. It is the deepest possible love: a love that isn't conditional on things staying the way you want them to.

Living the Teaching: Honoring What Was

Daniel starts a practice his grief counselor suggests.

Every morning, he sits quietly and acknowledges three things:

The argument with my father happened. That's real.

I wish I'd called him back. That's real.

This sorrow is not the whole story. Also real.

At first, the third statement feels like a lie. Like he's trying to minimize the loss.

But slowly, he begins to understand the distinction. Honoring the regret doesn't mean living in it. He can acknowledge the wish--I wish I'd called back--without demanding the impossible: that the past be different.

He can hold the sorrow--I miss him--without turning it into self-punishment.

One day, going through old photos, he finds a picture of his father laughing. Taken maybe five years before he died. Daniel remembers that day--just the two of them working on the old car in the garage.

And he realizes: the regret has been so loud that it drowned out everything else. That argument--painful as it was--was one moment in a relationship spanning forty-three years. There were thousands of other moments. Laughter. Connection. Ordinary days where nothing went wrong.

The regret wanted him to reduce the entire relationship to that final week. But it doesn't have to.

He can hold both: the regret and the love. The sorrow and the gratitude.

The past remains unchangeable. But his relationship to it can change.

Practice Box

1. Acknowledge what's real without drowning in it. Name the regret clearly: "I wish I had done X." Don't suppress it. But don't let it become the only truth about the situation.

2. Recognize impermanence as nature, not tragedy. Birth and death are certain. Relationships end. Moments pass. This is not a failure of reality. It is reality. Let this understanding soften the collision with loss.

3. Expand the frame. Regret narrows your vision to one moment. Deliberately recall other moments--good ones, ordinary ones, ones where love was present. The regretted moment is real, but it is not the whole story.

4. Act in the present. You cannot fix yesterday. But you can live today with more awareness, more compassion, more presence. Let regret become a teacher, not a prison.

The Way Forward

Five years after his father's death, Daniel is at a family gathering when his nephew--seventeen, angry, in the middle of a fight with his own father--storms out.

Daniel finds him in the driveway, sitting in his car.

"Want to talk?"

The kid shrugs. "He doesn't get it. He never gets it."

Daniel leans against the car. "Can I tell you something?"

"Sure."

"I had a fight with my dad, week before he died. Stupid fight. I hung up on him. Never called back. Then he was gone."

The kid looks at him. "Damn."

"Yeah. And I regretted it for years. Still do, sometimes. But you know what I learned?"

"What?"

"That I can't change that moment. But I can change this one. And so can you."

The kid is quiet.

"You don't have to make up with your dad right now. You don't even have to want to. But you get to choose how this goes. Whether this fight is the last word, or just one fight in a longer story."

Ten minutes later, the kid goes back inside. Daniel doesn't know if he'll talk to his father tonight. Maybe he will. Maybe he won't.

But Daniel knows this: he just did something his own regret couldn't do. He couldn't go back and call his father. But he could stand in this driveway and offer his nephew a choice. Could turn the sorrow into wisdom. The regret into service.

The past is still unchangeable.

But the present--right now, this moment--is wide open.

And in that openness, Daniel finds something he thought regret had stolen forever: the ability to act with love. Not because the sorrow has disappeared. But because the wise do not remain imprisoned by what they cannot change.

They learn from it. They honor it. And they live.

Reflection

- What past moment do you wish you could change? What would you do differently?
- Can you hold both the regret and the gratitude--the painful moment and the thousands of others?
- How might your sorrow, if you stopped fighting it and started learning from it, change how you live today?
