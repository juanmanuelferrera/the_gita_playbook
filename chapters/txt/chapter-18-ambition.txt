# Chapter 18: Ambition

## The Next Rung

Natasha got the VP title at thirty-two.

Youngest in the company's history. Everyone said she was brilliant. Driven. Destined for the C-suite.

And she was. Is. She knows it.

But right now, sitting in the executive parking garage in her new car—the one she bought to celebrate the promotion—she feels empty.

Not disappointed. The promotion is real. The achievement is real. The salary increase, the corner office, the respect—all real.

But that feeling she was chasing? The one that was supposed to arrive when she finally made VP?

It's not here.

She thought getting here would feel like arrival. Like crossing a finish line. Like she could finally exhale and say, "I did it. I made it. I'm successful."

Instead, what she feels is: /What's next?/

The partners track is still above her. Then there's the executive committee. Then CEO. Then maybe board positions at other companies. Then...

There's always a next rung.

And she's already thinking about it. Already strategizing. Already feeling the familiar pull: /If I just get to the next level, THEN I'll feel satisfied. Then I'll have proven myself. Then I'll be enough./

But she felt that way about VP too. And about Director before that. And about Manager before that.

The ladder never ends. And the hunger never stops.

This is ambition. Not the healthy kind that motivates growth. The other kind. The kind that's never satisfied. That makes every achievement feel like just another step toward a goal that keeps receding.

Natasha doesn't know how to stop climbing.

But she's starting to wonder: What am I actually climbing toward?

## When Success Isn't Enough

Ambition isn't bad.

The desire to grow, to contribute, to build something meaningful, to develop your capacities—that's natural. Healthy. Part of being human.

But there's another kind of ambition.

The kind that's never satisfied. That treats every achievement as insufficient. That makes your worth conditional on the next milestone. That whispers: /You're only as good as your last success./

This kind of ambition operates on a simple lie:

/When I achieve X, THEN I'll be enough./

But here's what actually happens:

You achieve X. And for a moment—maybe hours, maybe days—you feel satisfaction. You did it. You proved yourself. You're successful.

Then the goalposts move.

What felt like "the top" becomes the new baseline. And suddenly, "enough" is one level higher. The partnership isn't enough if you're not senior partner. Senior partner isn't enough if you're not on the executive committee. The executive committee isn't enough if you're not CEO.

There's always another rung.

And the ambition says: /Just one more. Just get to THIS level, and THEN you'll have arrived./

But you never arrive. Because arrival isn't a place on the ladder. It's a way of relating to wherever you are.

The Bhagavad-gītā addresses this directly. Not ambition for its own sake, but the attachment to outcomes. The belief that achieving something external will finally make you feel complete internally.

It won't.

Because completeness isn't achieved. It's recognized. You're already whole, already enough, already complete—in your essential nature. The achievements don't add to that. They're just temporary expressions of capacities you already have.

But ambition doesn't want to hear that. Ambition wants to keep climbing. Because stopping feels like giving up. Like settling. Like admitting you're not good enough to reach the top.

So you keep climbing. And the ladder never ends. And the satisfaction never comes.

Until you recognize: the ladder is infinite. The only way to be satisfied is to stop measuring your worth by how high you've climbed.

## The Gītā Speaks: Beyond Achievement

Arjuna is ambitious.

He's a warrior. He wants victory. He wants glory. He wants to be recognized as the greatest archer, the finest warrior, the hero of the story.

That's what brought him to the battlefield.

But now, facing the actual cost of his ambition—the lives it will require, the relationships it will destroy—he's paralyzed.

Kṛṣṇa doesn't tell him to abandon ambition entirely. But he does say something radical:

> ``You have a right to perform your prescribed duty, but you are not entitled to the fruits of action. Never consider yourself the cause of the results of your activities, and never be attached to not doing your duty.''
>
> --- Bhagavad-gītā 2.47

You have the right to act. But not to the results.

This means: strive, work, build, grow—yes. But don't make your peace, your worth, your sense of completion dependent on achieving the outcome you want.

Do the work. Let go of the fruit.

Not because the fruit doesn't matter. But because attaching your well-being to getting it creates suffering.

You can't control whether you get the promotion. You can control the quality of your work. You can't control whether your project succeeds. You can control your effort and skill. You can't control recognition. You can control contribution.

Kṛṣṇa continues:

> ``Perform your duty equipoised, O Arjuna, abandoning all attachment to success or failure. Such equanimity is called yoga.''
>
> --- Bhagavad-gītā 2.48

Equanimity. Not indifference. Not lack of care. But equanimity—the steadiness that comes from doing excellent work without rising and falling based on outcomes.

You can be ambitious—want to grow, want to contribute, want to build. But make your satisfaction come from the quality of your effort, not from achieving the next rung.

One more verse:

> ``A person who is not disturbed by the incessant flow of desires—that enter like rivers into the ocean, which is ever being filled but is always still—can alone achieve peace, and not the person who strives to satisfy such desires.''
>
> --- Bhagavad-gītā 2.70

The ocean is always being filled. But it's always still.

That's the model. Desires arise—for achievement, for recognition, for the next level. Let them enter. But don't be disturbed by them. Don't make them conditions for your peace.

The ambitious person who tries to satisfy every desire never finds peace. The person who lets desires arise without being controlled by them finds peace even while striving.

## Living the Teaching: Ambition Without Attachment

Natasha starts seeing a coach.

Not because she's failing. Because she's succeeding and it feels hollow.

The coach asks her: "What are you trying to prove?"

She starts to answer—"That I'm capable, that I deserve to be here, that—"

And then stops.

/That I'm enough./

That's what she's trying to prove. With every promotion, every achievement, every rung climbed. She's trying to prove she's enough.

"And are you?" the coach asks.

"Am I what?"

"Enough."

Natasha pauses. The honest answer: "I don't know. I thought I would be when I made VP. But I'm not. So maybe when I make partner—"

"You'll still be asking that question," the coach says. "Because you're trying to answer it with achievements. But it's not an achievement question. It's an identity question."

Over the following months, Natasha tries something new.

She keeps working. Keeps striving. Keeps doing excellent work.

But she stops making her worth conditional on the next promotion.

When she's passed over for a project she wanted, instead of spiraling into "I'm not good enough," she asks: "Did I do my best work? Yes. Did I learn something? Yes. Is my worth as a person dependent on getting that project? No."

When she gets praise, instead of immediately thinking "Good, but what's next?", she lets herself acknowledge: "I did good work. That's satisfying. I don't need it to mean more than that."

When ambition arises—the pull toward the next level—she doesn't suppress it. But she doesn't obey it either. She just notices it.

/There's the ambition. The hunger for more. The belief that the next achievement will finally be enough./

And she chooses differently.

Not to stop striving. But to stop making satisfaction conditional on outcomes.

She can want the partnership. Can work toward it. But her peace doesn't depend on getting it.

That shift—subtle as it sounds—changes everything.

### Practice Box

**The Practice of Ambition Without Attachment**

1. **Name what you're actually chasing.** Is it the title? Or the feeling you think the title will give you? What are you trying to prove? To whom?

2. **Separate effort from outcome.** You control your work. You don't control whether it gets the recognition, promotion, or success you want. Give excellent effort. Let go of demanding specific results.

3. **Notice the moving goalposts.** When you achieve something, does satisfaction last? Or does the goal immediately shift? Recognize the pattern: achievement never satisfies if you're using it to prove your worth.

4. **Find satisfaction in quality, not outcome.** Ask after each project: ``Did I do my best work?'' If yes, let that be enough. Don't make your peace dependent on external validation.

5. **Remember you're already complete.** Your worth isn't on the ladder. You're the eternal self, witnessing the climb. The promotions don't make you more. The setbacks don't make you less. You already are.

Ambition without attachment means: strive fully, care deeply, but don't make your worth conditional on winning.

## The Way Forward: Climbing Without Climbing

Two years later, Natasha makes partner.

She gets the call. The congratulations. The announcement. Everything she worked toward for a decade.

And she feels... good. Satisfied. Accomplished.

But not complete. Because she already knows: completeness wasn't in the title.

That evening, a younger colleague—someone who reminds Natasha of herself five years ago—asks her: "How does it feel? You made it. You're at the top."

Natasha smiles. "I'm not at the top. There's always another level. But I'm also not trying to get there to prove I'm enough anymore."

"Then why do it?"

"Because it's interesting work. Because I can contribute. Because I'm good at it. But my worth isn't on the line every time I succeed or fail."

The colleague looks confused. Like that doesn't compute. Success is supposed to make you feel successful, right?

But Natasha knows better now.

Success is fine. Achievement is fine. Ambition is fine.

But none of them make you enough. They can't. Because you're already enough—not as an achievement, but as a fact of your existence.

The eternal self doesn't climb ladders. It witnesses the climb. And from that witness position, you can strive without suffering. Work without anxiety. Succeed without needing it to mean you're finally valuable.

A few months later, an opportunity comes up: CEO of a smaller company. High risk. High reward. The kind of thing the old Natasha would have jumped at without thinking.

This Natasha considers it carefully.

Not "Will this make me successful?" But: "Is this my dharma? Is this my role? Is this what's mine to do?"

She decides no. Not because she's afraid. Not because she couldn't do it. But because it's not aligned with what actually matters to her: impact, creativity, time with the people she loves.

The ambition voice screams: /You're settling! You're giving up! You could be CEO!/

But she knows better.

She's not giving up. She's choosing. And choosing from a place of already being enough, rather than trying to prove she is.

That's freedom.

Not freedom from ambition. But freedom from being enslaved by it.

She can climb when climbing serves something real. And she can stop when stopping serves something real.

The ladder is infinite. But she's not on it anymore.

She's here. Now. Doing work that matters. Not to prove she's enough.

But because she already is.

## Reflection

- What are you trying to prove with your ambition? To whom?
- When you achieve your current goal, do you let yourself feel satisfied? Or do the goalposts immediately move?
- What would change if you already believed you were enough—would you still be ambitious, or would the nature of your ambition transform?
