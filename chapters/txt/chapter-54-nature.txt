# Chapter 54: Nature

## Spring: Rajas

March.

Everything begins again.

Dr. Nakamura watches the cherry blossoms outside her office window and feels the pull.

Energy. Ambition. The drive to *do*.

She's been a psychiatrist for fifteen years, but spring always makes her restless.

New patients. New research proposals. New protocols to try.

*More. Better. Faster.*

The feeling is electric. Productive. She rides it hard—sees patients back-to-back, stays late writing grant proposals, volunteers for the hospital ethics committee.

By May, she's running on five hours of sleep and three cups of coffee.

"You're burning out," her partner says gently.

"I'm productive," Dr. Nakamura counters.

But she knows the truth:

She's not in control of the energy.

The energy is in control of her.

## Summer: Tamas

July.

The crash comes exactly when it always does.

The grants get rejected. Two long-term patients relapse. The committee work becomes political and draining.

Dr. Nakamura feels the heaviness descend.

Not quite depression. More like... inertia.

She shows up to work. Sees patients. Goes through the motions.

But the spark is gone.

At night, she scrolls social media for hours. Can't seem to stop. Can't seem to start anything that matters.

"Maybe you need a vacation," her partner suggests.

But Dr. Nakamura knows a vacation won't fix this.

Because it's not about circumstances.

It's about the mode she's operating in.

Tamasic. Heavy. Stuck.

She reads something in a book a patient recommended—the Bhagavad-gītā. Something about the three gunas, the three modes of material nature.

Goodness. Passion. Ignorance.

Sattva. Rajas. Tamas.

She recognizes herself immediately:

Spring was rajas. Passion. Activity without wisdom.

Summer is tamas. Ignorance. Inertia. Avoidance.

But there's a third mode.

One she's never quite accessed.

## Understanding the Forces

Most of us live at the mercy of nature's modes.

We don't choose them consciously.

They choose us.

Rajas pulls us into frenetic activity—productive on the surface, depleting underneath. We chase achievement, stimulation, movement. We can't sit still. Can't rest. Can't be satisfied.

Tamas pulls us into heaviness—sleep, avoidance, distraction, denial. We binge-watch, oversleep, procrastinate. We know what we should do and can't seem to do it.

These two modes trade places. Rajas burns itself out. Tamas builds until restlessness returns. Back and forth. Exhaustion and agitation. Frenzy and fog.

Most people spend their whole lives oscillating between passion and ignorance.

But the Gītā reveals a third way.

Sattva.

Goodness. Clarity. Balance.

Not the absence of energy—but energy aligned with wisdom.

Not the absence of rest—but rest that replenishes rather than avoids.

Dr. Nakamura realizes:

She's been mistaking rajas for health.

And wondering why it always collapses into tamas.

But there's another mode entirely.

## The Gītā Speaks: The Three Modes

Kṛṣṇa describes the modes of nature systematically:

> ``The mode of goodness conditions one to happiness; passion conditions one to fruitive action; and ignorance, covering one's knowledge, binds one to madness.''
>
> --- Bhagavad-gītā 14.9

Three modes. Three different experiences of life.

Sattva (goodness): clarity, peace, wisdom, sustainable joy.

Rajas (passion): activity, restlessness, attachment to results, temporary satisfaction.

Tamas (ignorance): confusion, heaviness, delusion, avoidance.

Later, Kṛṣṇa shows how to recognize which mode is operating:

> ``From sattva arises knowledge, from rajas greed, and from tamas foolishness, madness, and illusion.''
>
> --- Bhagavad-gītā 14.17

This is diagnostic.

When you feel clear, balanced, able to see things as they are—you're in sattva.

When you feel driven, greedy, never satisfied, always wanting more—you're in rajas.

When you feel confused, stuck, avoiding what you know needs doing—you're in tamas.

The modes aren't permanent.

They shift throughout the day. Throughout the year. Throughout your life.

But here's the key:

You can choose.

Not perfectly. Not always.

But more than you think.

## Living the Teaching: Cultivating Sattva

Dr. Nakamura doesn't quit her job.

Doesn't run away to meditate in the mountains.

Instead, she starts making small adjustments.

Mode by mode.

**She reduces rajas:**

Stops saying yes to every committee, every conference, every opportunity.

Asks: Does this serve, or does it just make me feel important?

Cuts caffeine in half. Stops checking email before bed.

**She addresses tamas:**

When she feels the heaviness coming, she doesn't avoid it with Netflix.

She sits with it. Feels it. Asks what it's trying to tell her.

Often, the answer is simple: she's exhausted because she burned herself out in rajas mode.

The solution isn't distraction. It's real rest.

**She cultivates sattva:**

Wakes early. Sits quietly for twenty minutes before the day begins.

Eats simpler food. Walks during lunch instead of scrolling.

Reads poetry. Spends time in nature. Has real conversations.

Nothing dramatic.

Just small shifts that accumulate.

### Practice Box

**The Practice of Working with the Modes**

\begin{enumerate}
\item **Recognize which mode is operating.** Throughout the day, notice: Am I clear and balanced (sattva)? Driven and restless (rajas)? Heavy and avoidant (tamas)? Just naming the mode weakens its unconscious grip.

\item **Reduce rajas.** Cut stimulation: less caffeine, less social media, less news, less frenetic activity. Say no more often. Ask: Am I doing this from wisdom—or from the compulsion to stay busy?

\item **Address tamas.** When heaviness arises, don't distract yourself. Sit with it. Move your body gently. Get sunlight. Do one small meaningful thing. Tamas thrives in avoidance; it dissolves in gentle action.

\item **Cultivate sattva.** Simple food. Early mornings. Nature. Silence. Real conversation. Beauty. Service. These aren't luxuries—they're how you access clarity and balance. Make them non-negotiable.

\item **Know you'll oscillate—and that's okay.** You won't stay in sattva permanently. The modes shift. What matters is recognizing when you've slipped into rajas or tamas—and consciously choosing to return to balance.
\end{enumerate}

The Gītā is pragmatic.

It doesn't promise you'll transcend nature's modes while living in a body.

But it shows you how to work with them.

How to stop being their victim.

How to choose—consciously, repeatedly—clarity over confusion.

## The Way Forward: Winter

December.

Dr. Nakamura sits in her office, watching the first snow fall.

She feels calm.

Not the forced calm of someone suppressing rajas.

Not the heavy calm of tamas.

Real calm. Sattvic calm.

She has energy—but it's not frenetic.

She rests—but it's not avoidance.

The day ahead is full: six patients, a supervision meeting, a presentation at rounds.

But she's not driven by it.

And she's not dreading it.

She's just... present.

Her partner notices the difference.

"You seem different," they say over breakfast.

Dr. Nakamura considers.

"I think I'm learning to work with my nature instead of being worked by it."

"What does that mean?"

She smiles.

"It means I'm not burning myself out in spring and crashing in summer anymore. I'm learning balance. Little by little."

That night, she writes in her journal:

*Sattva isn't the absence of energy or the absence of rest. It's energy that serves. Rest that replenishes. Clarity that sustains.*

*I've spent so long oscillating between too much and too little.*

*Maybe the path forward is the middle.*

*Not boring. Not passive.*

*Just... aligned.*

She closes the journal.

Outside, the snow continues to fall.

Quiet. Steady. Balanced.

Like the mode she's learning to inhabit.

## Reflection

- Which mode dominates your life right now? Are you driven and restless (rajas), heavy and avoidant (tamas), or balanced and clear (sattva)? When did you last feel truly sattvic—and what conditions allowed that?
- What would it mean to reduce rajas in your life? Where are you overstimulated, overcommitted, over-caffeinated, overextended? What would it feel like to say no more often—not from scarcity, but from wisdom?
- How could you cultivate more sattva? What simple choices create clarity and balance for you? Early mornings? Nature? Silence? Simpler food? Real conversation? What if these weren't luxuries, but necessities for sustainable living?
