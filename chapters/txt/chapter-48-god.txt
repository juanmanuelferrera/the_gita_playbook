# Chapter 48: God

## The Question

"What is God?"

The child asks this while they're walking home from school. Eight years old. Completely sincere.

Vijay freezes.

He's a scientist. An astrophysicist. He studies the measurable universe—galaxies, black holes, cosmic radiation.

His daughter is asking about the unmeasurable.

"Well," he starts, then stops.

What *is* God?

The question haunts him all evening. Through dinner. Through bedtime stories. Into the night when he should be sleeping.

He's always considered himself an agnostic. Not atheist—too definitive. But not believer either. Just... uncertain. Waiting for evidence.

But his daughter's question reveals something uncomfortable: he's never actually investigated. Never looked deeply. Never asked seriously.

He's dismissed the question as unanswerable. And moved on.

But what if it's not unanswerable? What if he's just never looked in the right place?

He opens his laptop. Types: "What is God?"

The answers flood in. Thousands of them. Contradictory. Confusing. Unsatisfying.

God is love. God is energy. God is consciousness. God is a bearded man in the sky. God is the universe. God is nothing. God is everything.

How is anyone supposed to make sense of this?

And then he remembers: he's a scientist. He knows how to investigate.

So maybe it's time to apply that rigor to the biggest question there is.

## The Search for Definition

Vijay approaches God the way he'd approach any scientific problem.

First: define what you're looking for.

But that's the problem. Everyone defines God differently.

The Christians say God is personal—Father, Son, Spirit.

The Muslims say God is one, absolute, transcendent.

The Buddhists don't even use the word—they speak of emptiness, of Buddha-nature.

The Hindus have millions of gods—or one God with infinite forms—depending on who you ask.

How do you investigate something no one can agree on?

Vijay tries a different approach. Instead of asking what people say about God, he asks: what would God have to be?

If God exists, what properties would God necessarily have?

Infinite. Otherwise limited, and therefore not God.

Eternal. Otherwise created, and therefore not God.

Conscious. Otherwise less than humans, and therefore not God.

The source of everything. Otherwise dependent, and therefore not God.

So if God exists, God must be: infinite, eternal, conscious, and the source of all existence.

That's... actually a workable definition.

But does anything matching that description exist?

Vijay doesn't know. But now, at least, he knows what he's looking for.

## The Gītā Speaks: The Nature of the Divine

Kṛṣṇa doesn't prove God exists. He describes what God is.

And the description is... precise.

> ``I am the source of all spiritual and material worlds. Everything emanates from Me. The wise who perfectly know this engage in My devotional service and worship Me with all their hearts.''
>
> --- Bhagavad-gītā 10.8

**The source of all.** Not part of the system. The origin of the system.

**Everything emanates from Me.** Not created externally. Manifested from within.

**The wise who know this.** This isn't faith against evidence. It's recognition based on investigation.

Later, Kṛṣṇa expands:

> ``But what need is there, Arjuna, for all this detailed knowledge? With a single fragment of Myself I pervade and support this entire universe.''
>
> --- Bhagavad-gītā 10.42

**A single fragment.** The entire manifest universe—billions of galaxies, trillions of stars—is an infinitesimal expression of God.

**I pervade and support.** Not distant. Intimate. Present in every atom.

This isn't the bearded man in the sky. This is consciousness itself. The ground of being. The infinite expressing through the finite.

Vijay reads this and something clicks.

This matches what physics is discovering.

Quantum mechanics says consciousness collapses the wave function—reality literally depends on observation.

Cosmology says the universe emerged from a singularity—something from apparent nothing.

Neuroscience can't locate consciousness in the brain—it's non-local, fundamental.

Maybe God isn't against science. Maybe God is what science keeps pointing toward but can't measure.

The unmeasurable reality that makes measurement possible.

## Living the Teaching: From Concept to Experience

Vijay can't prove God exists.

But he realizes: that's not the right question.

The right question is: can I experience what "God" points toward?

He starts meditating. Not religiously. Experimentally.

If consciousness is fundamental—if it pervades everything—can he experience that?

### Practice Box

**The Practice of Investigating God**

**1. Define clearly.** What are you looking for? Not what others say, but what would "God" have to be? Start with clear definitions.

**2. Look for evidence.** Not in texts alone. In reality. Does the universe behave as if consciousness is fundamental? As if intelligence underlies order?

**3. Experiment directly.** Meditate. Contemplate. Look for the source of your own awareness. Can you find where consciousness begins?

**4. Test the descriptions.** The Gītā says God pervades all. Can you experience that? Sit quietly. Look. What's aware of your looking?

**5. Let experience guide belief.** Don't accept or reject based on doctrine. Investigate. Experience. Then decide what's true for you.

Vijay sits. Closes his eyes. Watches his breath.

At first, just thoughts. Distractions. The usual mental noise.

But then, gradually, something else.

A space. An awareness. Something watching the thoughts without being the thoughts.

He can't grasp it. Can't hold it. Can't measure it.

But it's there. Undeniably there.

And it's not separate from him. It's what he is. Beneath the thoughts. Beneath the identity. Beneath "Vijay."

Pure awareness. Consciousness without content.

Is this God?

He doesn't know. But it's closer than anything he's found in any book.

Three months later, his daughter asks again. "Dad, did you ever figure out what God is?"

Vijay smiles. "I don't know if I can explain it. But I can show you a practice. A way to look. And you can see for yourself."

"See what?"

"The awareness that's looking through your eyes. The consciousness that's reading your thoughts. The... presence that's always been here but we usually ignore."

She frowns. "Is that God?"

"I think," Vijay says carefully, "that's as close as we can get. Not a definition. Not a description. Just... direct experience of what's real. What's always been real. What everything comes from."

"That's confusing."

"It is," he agrees. "Until you experience it. Then it's the most obvious thing there is."

## The Way Forward: The God Beyond Concepts

Vijay still doesn't call himself religious.

But he meditates daily. Reads the Gītā. Investigates consciousness.

Not as belief. As exploration.

A colleague asks, "So you believe in God now?"

Vijay thinks about it. "I don't know if 'believe' is the right word. I experience something. Something fundamental. Something infinite. Whether I call it God or consciousness or the ground of being... the name doesn't matter as much as the reality."

"But you can't prove it."

"No," Vijay admits. "You can't prove consciousness to someone who won't look within. You can't prove God to someone who won't investigate. But you also can't prove love to someone who's never felt it. Some things require direct experience."

"So it's subjective?"

"Maybe," Vijay says. "Or maybe it's the only thing that's truly objective. Maybe God is what remains when all the subjective experiences fall away. The awareness itself. Infinite. Eternal. The source of everything."

"That sounds like science fiction."

Vijay laughs. "It sounds like physics. Consciousness as the fundamental field. Intelligence as the ordering principle. The universe as self-aware. We're just waking up to what mystics have said for millennia."

Because God isn't a hypothesis to accept or reject.

God is the reality you investigate by looking inward. By questioning consciousness itself. By asking: what's aware of this moment?

And when you look—really look—you find something that can't be named but can be known.

Something infinite expressing through the finite.

Something eternal experiencing through the temporal.

Something whole appearing as the many.

Call it God. Call it Brahman. Call it consciousness. Call it the Tao.

The name is just a pointer.

The reality is what you are.

## Reflection

- What is your working definition of God? Not what you've been told, but what would God have to be for the word to mean something real?
- Have you investigated or assumed? Have you looked within for the source of consciousness, or accepted others' claims about what exists?
- Can you experience the awareness that's reading these words right now? What is that awareness? Where does it come from? Could that be what "God" points toward?
