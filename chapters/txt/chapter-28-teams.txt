Chapter 28: Teams

The Broken Project

Sanjay stands at the whiteboard in the conference room, marker in hand, facing five colleagues who won't make eye contact.

The product launch is in three weeks. They're nowhere near ready.

"Okay," he says, trying to keep his voice steady. "Let's go through the blockers one more time. Design team -- where are we on the UI mockups?"

Melissa, the lead designer, sighs. "Still waiting on requirements from product. I sent three emails last week. No response."

Marcus Webb, the product manager, looks up sharply. "I responded to two of them. You're the one who keeps changing the design without consulting anyone."

"Because your requirements were vague! I had to make assumptions --"

"Your assumptions broke the entire user flow --"

"Stop." Sanjay raises a hand. The room falls silent, but the tension remains, thick and suffocating.

This is the third meeting this week that's devolved into blame-shifting. Engineering blames product. Product blames design. Design blames engineering. Everyone blames everyone, and nothing moves forward.

Sanjay is supposed to be leading this team. But right now, he feels like he's herding cats. Angry, territorial cats who'd rather fight each other than ship the product.

How did it get this bad? he wonders. Six months ago, this team was functioning. Now we can barely get through a meeting without someone storming out.

"Look," he says. "We're all under pressure. I get it. But we're on the same side here. Can we just focus on solving the problems instead of arguing about who caused them?"

Silence. Then Melissa mutters, just loud enough to hear: "Easy for you to say. You're not the one being blamed for everything."

Sanjay closes his eyes. This is going to be a long three weeks.


The Illusion of Individual Victory

Teams are supposed to multiply capability. One person can only do so much. But five people working together -- aligned, coordinated, trusting -- can accomplish what seems impossible alone.

That's the theory.

The reality is messier.

Because teams are made of individuals. And individuals have egos, insecurities, agendas. They compete for credit, deflect blame, protect territory.

And when trust breaks down -- when team members stop seeing each other as allies and start seeing each other as obstacles -- the team becomes less than the sum of its parts.

Sanjay's team isn't dysfunctional because people are incompetent. They're talented. Skilled. Individually brilliant.

But brilliance divided against itself is useless.

The design team thinks they're right. The product team thinks they're right. Engineering thinks everyone else is making their job impossible.

And they're all so focused on being right, on protecting their turf, that they've forgotten what they're trying to build together.


The Gita Speaks: One Goal, Many Duties

Arjuna stands on the battlefield confused, paralyzed by the complexity of what's being asked of him. He turns to Krishna and admits his helplessness:

   "Now I am confused about my duty and have lost all composure because of weakness."

   -- Bhagavad-gita 2.7

Sanjay knows this feeling. The team is fractured. The deadline is looming. And he has lost all composure. But Krishna's response to Arjuna's confusion is not sympathy -- it is clarity about purpose:

   "Those who are on this path are very determined, and their goal is one."

   -- Bhagavad-gita 2.41

One goal. Not five individual goals. Not Melissa's goal, Marcus's goal, Priya's goal. One shared purpose that every member serves through their particular duty.

When a team forgets the shared goal, each person defaults to their private one: being right, being recognized, being safe. That is how teams fracture.

And Krishna says something even more pointed about how leaders and skilled people must behave:

   "Whatever action is performed by a great man, common men follow in his footsteps."

   -- Bhagavad-gita 3.21

If Sanjay blames, the team will blame. If he defends his ego, they will defend theirs. The leader's behavior sets the pattern. But this also applies to every senior member: Melissa's defensiveness gives permission for everyone to be defensive. Marcus's vagueness gives permission for everyone to be vague.

And then this -- a caution for anyone tempted to force clarity on others before finding it themselves:

   "Let not the wise disrupt the minds of the ignorant who are attached to fruitive action."

   -- Bhagavad-gita 3.26

Sanjay cannot lecture his team into alignment. He cannot shame them into cooperation. He must model the shift himself -- from blame to function, from ego to duty -- and trust that the example will do more than any mandate.

And when that shift happens, when ego surrenders to shared purpose, the result is liberation:

   "A man engaged in devotional service rids himself of both good and bad actions even in this life. Therefore strive for yoga, O Arjuna, which is the art of all work."

   -- Bhagavad-gita 2.50

Yoga -- the art of all work. Not individual achievement. Not personal credit. The art of working together in service to something larger than any one person's ego.

At the end of the Gita, after everything Krishna has taught, Arjuna's response is simple and complete:

   "Arjuna said: My dear Krishna, O You Infallible, now my illusion has dissipated. By Your mercy I have recovered my memory."

   -- Bhagavad-gita 18.73

The illusion that dissipates is the illusion of separateness. Arjuna remembers who he is and what he is meant to do -- not alone, but in relationship. That is what every broken team needs: not new processes, but recovered memory. The memory that they are on the same side.


Living the Teaching

So what does Sanjay do?

Force everyone to play nice? Issue mandates? Fire the troublemakers?

No.

He needs to shift the team from blame to function. From "who's right" to "what works."

Practice Box

The Team Dharma Practice

1. Reframe from blame to function.
Stop asking: "Who caused this problem?" Start asking: "What function needs to be performed to solve this?" Focus on roles, not righteousness.

2. Model the shift yourself.
Don't ask the team to do what you won't. Drop your own defensiveness first. Admit your own failures. The leader goes first -- and so does anyone wise enough to lead by example.

3. Return to the one goal.
Every meeting, every conversation, bring it back: What are we building together? Not "what's my piece" but "what's our purpose." One goal. Many duties.

4. Release attachment to individual credit.
The team wins or loses together. Your ego's need for recognition is less important than the team's collective success.


The Way Forward

Sanjay calls another meeting. But this time, he changes the format.

"Before we talk about tasks," he says, "I want to try something different. I'm going to ask each person to state their primary function on this team. Not your title. Not your grievances. Just: What is your duty here? What are you responsible for contributing?"

Melissa goes first, reluctantly. "I'm responsible for creating an interface that users can navigate intuitively."

"Good," Sanjay says. "Marcus?"

"I'm responsible for defining what the product needs to accomplish and ensuring we're building the right thing."

"Exactly. And engineering?"

Priya, the tech lead, says quietly, "We're responsible for building something that actually works. Reliably."

Sanjay nods. "Okay. So here's what I notice: Everyone's duty is different. And they're all necessary. Design can't ship without engineering. Engineering can't build without product. Product can't define requirements without design input."

He pauses. "We're not competing. We're interdependent. And when we fight over who's right, we all lose."

Silence. Then Melissa says, voice softer now, "I know I've been defensive. I just... I felt like everything was my fault."

"It's not," Marcus says. "I've been vague with requirements because I'm scared of committing to the wrong thing. I pushed that uncertainty onto you. That wasn't fair."

Priya adds, "And I've been silently resenting both of you instead of speaking up when things didn't make technical sense. That's on me."

Sanjay feels the room shift. Not fixed -- there's still work to do. But the blame cycle is breaking.

"Okay," he says. "New approach. Every meeting, we start with: What's my duty today? And how can I support others in theirs? Not: Who screwed up? But: What needs to happen next?"

They try it. That afternoon. The next day. It's clunky at first. People slip back into blame.

But slowly, something changes.

Melissa starts asking Marcus for clarification instead of assuming. Marcus starts giving feedback earlier instead of after designs are done. Priya starts flagging technical constraints before they become blockers.

They're not a perfect team. But they're functioning again.

Three weeks later, they ship. Not flawlessly. But together.

And at the launch party, Melissa raises her glass. "To the team that almost killed each other but didn't."

Everyone laughs. Because it's true.

Sanjay adds quietly, "To remembering we're on the same side."

They drink to that.

Because that's the secret: Teams work when individuals stop fighting to be right and start serving their function.

When ego surrenders to duty.

When "me" becomes "we."


Reflection

- On your team, are you focused on your duty or on being right? How does that focus affect the team's ability to work together?
- Where are you prioritizing individual credit over collective success? What would change if you released attachment to recognition?
- When your team faces conflict, do you seek to blame or to solve? Can you shift from "who caused this" to "what needs to happen next"?
