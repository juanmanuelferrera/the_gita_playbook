# Chapter 28: Teams

## The Broken Project

Sanjay stands at the whiteboard in the conference room, marker in hand, facing five colleagues who won't make eye contact.

The product launch is in three weeks. They're nowhere near ready.

"Okay," he says, trying to keep his voice steady. "Let's go through the blockers one more time. Design team—where are we on the UI mockups?"

Melissa, the lead designer, sighs. "Still waiting on requirements from product. I sent three emails last week. No response."

Marcus Webb, the product manager, looks up sharply. "I responded to two of them. You're the one who keeps changing the design without consulting anyone."

"Because your requirements were vague! I had to make assumptions—"

"Your assumptions broke the entire user flow—"

"Stop." Sanjay raises a hand. The room falls silent, but the tension remains, thick and suffocating.

This is the third meeting this week that's devolved into blame-shifting. Engineering blames product. Product blames design. Design blames engineering. Everyone blames everyone, and nothing moves forward.

Sanjay is supposed to be leading this team. But right now, he feels like he's herding cats. Angry, territorial cats who'd rather fight each other than ship the product.

*How did it get this bad?* he wonders. *Six months ago, this team was functioning. Now we can barely get through a meeting without someone storming out.*

"Look," he says. "We're all under pressure. I get it. But we're on the same side here. Can we just focus on solving the problems instead of arguing about who caused them?"

Silence. Then Melissa mutters, just loud enough to hear: "Easy for you to say. You're not the one being blamed for everything."

Sanjay closes his eyes. This is going to be a long three weeks.

## The Illusion of Individual Victory

Teams are supposed to multiply capability. One person can only do so much. But five people working together—aligned, coordinated, trusting—can accomplish what seems impossible alone.

That's the theory.

The reality is messier.

Because teams are made of individuals. And individuals have egos, insecurities, agendas. They compete for credit, deflect blame, protect territory.

And when trust breaks down—when team members stop seeing each other as allies and start seeing each other as obstacles—the team becomes less than the sum of its parts.

Sanjay's team isn't dysfunctional because people are incompetent. They're talented. Skilled. Individually brilliant.

But brilliance divided against itself is useless.

The design team thinks they're right. The product team thinks they're right. Engineering thinks everyone else is making their job impossible.

And they're all so focused on being right, on protecting their turf, that they've forgotten what they're trying to build together.

This is the trap: When you prioritize your individual correctness over the team's collective success, you doom both.

Because no one wins alone. Not really.

## The Gītā Speaks: Unity in Action

The Bhagavad-gītā opens on a battlefield. And not just any army—a divided one.

On one side, the Pāṇḍavas. On the other, the Kauravas. But these aren't foreign enemies—they're cousins. Family. People who should be united but are tearing each other apart.

Sound familiar?

Arjuna looks at this fractured situation and breaks down. "How can we fight our own relatives?" he asks.

And Kṛṣṇa's response cuts through the dysfunction:

> ``Perform your duty equipoised, O Arjuna, abandoning all attachment to success or failure. Such equanimity is called yoga.''
>
> --- Bhagavad-gītā 2.48

Notice what Kṛṣṇa focuses on: Not who's right or wrong. Not who deserves credit or blame.

But /duty/. Function. Your actual role in service to the whole.

When team members are attached to being right, to individual success, to protecting their ego—they lose sight of the purpose.

But when they focus on their duty—their function in service to the shared goal—alignment becomes possible.

Melissa's duty isn't to be right about design. It's to create an interface that serves users.

Marcus's duty isn't to win arguments about requirements. It's to articulate what the product needs to accomplish.

Sanjay's duty isn't to manage personalities. It's to create the conditions for the team to succeed together.

And here's the radical part:

> ``One who is not envious but who is a kind friend to all living entities, who does not think himself a proprietor, who is free from false ego and equal both in happiness and distress, who is always satisfied and engaged in devotional service with determination—such a person is very dear to Me.''
>
> --- Bhagavad-gītā 12.13-14

The qualities of a good team member: Not envious. Not possessive. Free from false ego. Equal in success and failure.

That's not soft skills. That's the foundation of effective collaboration.

Because teams fail when egos collide. They succeed when individuals surrender their need to be right in service to something larger.

## Living the Teaching: From Blame to Function

So what does Sanjay do?

Force everyone to play nice? Issue mandates? Fire the troublemakers?

No.

He needs to shift the team from blame to function. From "who's right" to "what works."

Here's the practice:

### Practice Box

**The Team Dharma Practice**

**1. Reframe from blame to function.**
Stop asking: ``Who caused this problem?'' Start asking: ``What function needs to be performed to solve this?'' Focus on roles, not righteousness.

**2. Clarify actual duties.**
Each person's /dharma/ on the team is their function—what they contribute to the whole. When everyone is clear on their duty (and respects others'), overlap and conflict decrease.

**3. Release attachment to individual credit.**
The team wins or loses together. Your ego's need for recognition is less important than the team's collective success. Can you accept that?

**4. Practice equanimity in success and failure.**
When things go well, share credit. When things go badly, focus on solutions, not blame. Steadiness builds trust.

This is hard. Brutally hard.

Because egos don't surrender easily. And when you've been blamed unfairly, the instinct is to defend yourself, to prove you were right.

But that instinct—however justified—destroys teams.

The Gītā offers a different path: Focus on your duty. Perform it skillfully. Release your attachment to being recognized for it.

Serve the whole. Not your ego.

## The Way Forward: The Reset

Sanjay calls another meeting. But this time, he changes the format.

"Before we talk about tasks," he says, "I want to try something different. I'm going to ask each person to state their primary function on this team. Not your title. Not your grievances. Just: What is your duty here? What are you responsible for contributing?"

Melissa goes first, reluctantly. "I'm responsible for creating an interface that users can navigate intuitively."

"Good," Sanjay says. "Marcus?"

"I'm responsible for defining what the product needs to accomplish and ensuring we're building the right thing."

"Exactly. And engineering?"

Priya, the tech lead, says quietly, "We're responsible for building something that actually works. Reliably."

Sanjay nods. "Okay. So here's what I notice: Everyone's duty is different. And they're all necessary. Design can't ship without engineering. Engineering can't build without product. Product can't define requirements without design input."

He pauses. "We're not competing. We're interdependent. And when we fight over who's right, we all lose."

Silence. Then Melissa says, voice softer now, "I know I've been defensive. I just... I felt like everything was my fault."

"It's not," Marcus says. "I've been vague with requirements because I'm scared of committing to the wrong thing. I pushed that uncertainty onto you. That wasn't fair."

Priya adds, "And I've been silently resenting both of you instead of speaking up when things didn't make technical sense. That's on me."

Sanjay feels the room shift. Not fixed—there's still work to do. But the blame cycle is breaking.

"Okay," he says. "New approach. Every meeting, we start with: What's my duty today? And how can I support others in theirs? Not: Who screwed up? But: What needs to happen next?"

They try it. That afternoon. The next day. It's clunky at first. People slip back into blame.

But slowly, something changes.

Melissa starts asking Marcus for clarification instead of assuming. Marcus starts giving feedback earlier instead of after designs are done. Priya starts flagging technical constraints before they become blockers.

They're not a perfect team. But they're functioning again.

Three weeks later, they ship. Not flawlessly. But together.

And at the launch party, Melissa raises her glass. "To the team that almost killed each other but didn't."

Everyone laughs. Because it's true.

Sanjay adds quietly, "To remembering we're on the same side."

They drink to that.

Because that's the secret: Teams work when individuals stop fighting to be right and start serving their function.

When ego surrenders to duty.

When "me" becomes "we."

## Reflection

- On your team, are you focused on your duty or on being right? How does that focus affect the team's ability to work together?
- Where are you prioritizing individual credit over collective success? What would change if you released attachment to recognition?
- When your team faces conflict, do you seek to blame or to solve? Can you shift from "who caused this" to "what needs to happen next"?
