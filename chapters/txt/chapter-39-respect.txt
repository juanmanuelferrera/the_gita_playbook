Chapter 39: Respect

Opening Story

Carlos has worked at the hospital for twenty-two years.

He's not a doctor. Not a nurse. He's in environmental services--the official term for custodian.

He mops floors. Empties trash. Cleans rooms after patients are discharged.

Most people don't see him. And when they do, they don't really look.

But Carlos sees everything. The frantic energy of the ER at 3 AM. The quiet grief of families saying goodbye. The exhausted nurses who nod thank you when he restocks the supply closet they forgot to check.

He knows this hospital like he knows his own home.

One afternoon, a new administrator starts her rounds. Young. Ivy League MBA. Here to "optimize operations."

She watches Carlos clean a room. Frowns. "This is inefficient. You're using too much time per room."

Carlos looks up. "Ma'am, this is ICU. These rooms need--"

"I've reviewed the data," she interrupts. "You're 20% slower than the benchmark. We need to bring that down."

"The benchmark doesn't account for--"

"I'm not interested in excuses. Just results. Can you improve, or do we need to find someone who can?"

Carlos doesn't say anything. He just nods. Finishes his work. Moves to the next room.

But something inside him hardens.

Reflective Bridge

Everyone wants to be seen. Really seen.

Not just acknowledged as a function--the person who cleans, who serves, who fixes, who delivers. But recognized as a human being with skill, with care, with value that transcends their role.

Respect isn't about status. It's about dignity.

Carlos doesn't need the administrator to praise him. He doesn't need her to understand the twenty-two years of institutional knowledge he carries. He just needs her to see him as more than a number on a spreadsheet.

But she didn't. And that dismissal cuts deeper than criticism. Because criticism implies you're seen well enough to be evaluated. Dismissal means you're not seen at all.

The administrator's behavior reveals something. Not just rudeness--a worldview. One where people exist as instruments of productivity. Where value is measured by speed, not by care. Where the person in front of you is invisible unless they serve your metrics.

The Gita has a name for this way of seeing. And a warning about where it leads.

The Gita Speaks: The Two Visions

There is an established order to things. A way that human life is meant to function--with reciprocity, with recognition, with sacrifice for the common good. Krishna warns:

  "My dear Arjuna, one who in human life does not follow the established cycle of sacrifices as prescribed by the Vedas certainly leads a life filled with sin."

  -- Bhagavad-gita 3.16

The cycle of sacrifice. Everyone contributes. Everyone is honored for their contribution. The doctor heals. The custodian maintains the space where healing happens. The administrator ensures the system functions. Break any link, and the whole chain suffers.

The administrator dismissed Carlos not because she was evil, but because she didn't see the chain. She saw only her link.

And yet, Krishna also offers this honest observation:

  "Even a man of knowledge acts according to his own nature, for everyone follows his nature. What can repression accomplish?"

  -- Bhagavad-gita 3.33

People act from their conditioning. The administrator was trained to see efficiency, not dignity. She followed her nature--the nature of someone taught that data matters more than people. Repressing that conditioning won't change it. Only awareness will.

But when that conditioning goes unchecked--when a person builds their entire worldview around self-importance and the dismissal of others--the Gita is blunt about what follows:

  "Following these conclusions, demonic people, who are lost and lack intelligence, engage in harmful and dreadful deeds aimed at destroying the world."

  -- Bhagavad-gita 16.9

  "Taking refuge in insatiable lust and absorbed in the vanity of pride and false prestige, demonic people, deceived in this way, are always devoted to dirty deeds, drawn by the temporal."

  -- Bhagavad-gita 16.10

This isn't about horns and pitchforks. It's about a mindset. The vanity of pride and false prestige. The person who believes their MBA makes them more valuable than someone with twenty-two years of hands-on wisdom. The person absorbed in metrics while the human being in front of them disappears.

And where does that mindset end?

  "The demoniac person thinks: 'So much wealth do I have today... I am the lord of everything, I am the enjoyer, I am perfect, powerful and happy... I am the richest man, surrounded by aristocratic relatives.' In this way, such persons are deluded by ignorance."

  -- Bhagavad-gita 16.13-15

"I am the lord of everything." This is the ultimate disrespect--not toward any one person, but toward reality itself. The belief that you are the center. That others exist to serve your vision. That your position grants you the right to dismiss.

Carlos has met this mindset before. Twenty-two years of administrators who come and go. But the hospital stays. He stays.

Living the Teaching

A week later, the administrator is back. She's shadowing Carlos again, clipboard in hand.

But this time, something's different. She watches him work. Really watches. And after a few rooms, she asks, "Why do you spend extra time in ICU rooms?"

Carlos pauses. Usually, this is where he gets told he's wrong. But she's actually asking.

"ICU patients are fragile," he says. "Extra cleaning protocols. And families--they're scared. If they see someone being careless, it adds to their stress. So I go slower. I'm thorough. They notice."

The administrator writes something down. "How long have you worked here?"

"Twenty-two years."

She looks up. "So you've seen administrators come and go."

Carlos allows himself a small smile. "A few."

She nods. "I'm sure you have. I'm sorry I dismissed your input last week. I was focused on the data and missed the context. That was my mistake."

Carlos blinks. He wasn't expecting that.

Practice Box

1. See the person, not the role. Before you interact with anyone--cashier, CEO, stranger--pause. This is a conscious being with thoughts, struggles, dignity. Not a function.

2. Honor the cycle of sacrifice. Everyone contributes. The custodian, the nurse, the administrator--each role sustains the whole. Dismissing any link weakens the chain.

3. Check your conditioning. When you're tempted to dismiss someone, ask: Am I acting from awareness or from the vanity of pride and false prestige? Be honest.

4. Listen like it matters. When someone speaks, listen fully. Not to evaluate. Not to optimize. To understand. Twenty-two years of knowledge doesn't show up on a spreadsheet.

Carlos starts meeting with the administrator weekly. She asks questions. He shares what he's learned. Together, they redesign some of the workflows--not to speed things up, but to reduce waste while maintaining quality.

The administrator credits him in her report. She makes sure his supervisor knows his contribution.

It doesn't erase the initial dismissal. But it shows that people can learn. Can change. Can choose to see what they initially missed.

The Way Forward

Months later, the administrator is still there. Carlos jokes that she might actually stick around.

One day, she asks him, "How do you do it? Stay patient with all the people who've talked down to you over the years?"

Carlos thinks about it.

"I decided a long time ago," he says, "that my dignity doesn't depend on whether people see it. It's there whether they acknowledge it or not."

"But doesn't it hurt?" she asks. "Being dismissed?"

"Of course it does," Carlos says. "But if I tie my respect to whether others give it, I lose twice. Once when they dismiss me. And again when I diminish myself."

The administrator nods slowly. "That's wisdom."

Carlos smiles. "That's survival."

But it's also truth.

The person who sees everyone--who honors the cycle of sacrifice, who refuses to be absorbed in the vanity of pride--that person walks through the world whole. Not because everyone sees them. But because they see everyone.

Including themselves.

Reflection

- Who do you dismiss without realizing it? The person who serves your coffee? The person who cleans your office? Where have you broken the cycle of sacrifice by refusing to see someone's contribution?
- When you feel dismissed, where does your dignity actually come from? External validation--or something deeper that no one can take from you?
- What conditioning shapes how you see others? Are you acting from awareness, or from the vanity of pride and false prestige that the Gita warns against?
