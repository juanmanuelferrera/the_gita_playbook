Chapter 5: Confusion

The Paralysis of Choice

Jordan sits at the kitchen table with two acceptance letters spread in front of him like tarot cards predicting divergent futures.

Left: Stanford. Full ride. Neuroscience. The dream he's chased since high school when he first read about neural plasticity and felt something click in his brain. His parents' pride. His teachers' predictions. The logical choice.

Right: Berklee College of Music. Partial scholarship. Composition. The thing he does at 2 AM when he can't sleep, when equations stop making sense and only melodies explain what he's feeling. His secret. His fear. The impossible choice.

He's been staring at these letters for three days.

Stanford says: "Be serious. Be practical. Do what makes sense."

Berklee says: "Be real. Be yourself. Do what makes you alive."

And Jordan? Jordan has no idea who he actually is or which voice is telling the truth.

His phone buzzes. His mom: "Stanford deadline is Friday. Just confirming you already submitted?"

He hasn't.

His best friend: "Dude, Berklee. Obviously. You're miserable in science."

He isn't. He loves science. Just... differently than he loves music.

His girlfriend: "Whatever makes you happy!"

But what DOES make him happy? And how is he supposed to know? And what if he chooses wrong and spends the rest of his life wondering about the path not taken?

Jordan puts his head in his hands.

This shouldn't be this hard. People make decisions every day. Pick schools, careers, partners, cities. They choose and move forward and apparently don't spend months paralyzed by the terror of picking incorrectly.

What's wrong with him that he can't just decide?


When Every Path Looks Equally Right and Wrong

Confusion isn't always about lack of information.

Sometimes you have ALL the information. You've made the pro/con lists. Consulted everyone. Researched exhaustively. And you're still frozen because both options--or all options--seem simultaneously perfect and catastrophic.

This is different from indecision. Indecision is "I don't know which I want."

Confusion is "I don't know which I AM."

Jordan's confusion isn't about Stanford versus Berklee. It's about which version of himself is the real one. The scientist or the artist. The logical son or the creative soul. The person everyone expects or the person he suspects he might be.

And our culture makes this worse by insisting you must have a singular, coherent identity. Pick a lane. Commit to a narrative. Be one thing.

But humans aren't one thing. Jordan isn't EITHER a scientist OR a musician. He's both. And also neither. And trying to stuff the complexity of human consciousness into a single choice feels like cutting off limbs to fit through a doorway.

No wonder he's confused.


The Gita Speaks: The Courage to Admit You Don't Know

The entire Bhagavad-gita exists because Arjuna is confused. Desperately, completely, existentially confused. And he does something that our culture rarely rewards: he admits it.

"Now I am confused about my duty and have lost all composure because of weakness. In this condition I am asking You to tell me clearly what is best for me. Now I am Your disciple, and a soul surrendered unto You. Please instruct me."

-- Bhagavad-gita 2.7

Arjuna doesn't just admit confusion--he surrenders to it. Stops pretending he knows. Asks for help.

This is radical.

Our culture treats confusion as weakness. As something to hide. As evidence that you're not smart enough, not together enough, not adult enough.

But Krishna doesn't shame Arjuna for being confused. He honors the confusion. He sees it as the beginning of wisdom. Because you cannot learn what you think you already know.

Jordan has been pretending to almost-know for three days. Everyone around him acts as though the answer is obvious--Stanford! Berklee! Whatever makes you happy!--and he smiles and nods and feels more lost with every confident opinion. What if the bravest thing he could do is what Arjuna did: admit that he genuinely does not know, and ask for guidance from someone who sees further than he can?

But Arjuna's confusion goes deeper than a single moment. Even after Krishna begins teaching, Arjuna encounters another layer of bewilderment:

"My intelligence is bewildered by Your equivocal instructions. Therefore, please tell me decisively which will be most beneficial for me."

-- Bhagavad-gita 3.2

This is the confusion within the confusion. Arjuna has asked for help. He's received teaching. And he's MORE confused than before. Because real guidance doesn't always simplify--sometimes it reveals that the question was more complex than you thought.

Jordan's friends gave simple advice. His mother gave simple advice. His girlfriend gave simple advice. And none of it helped because the question wasn't simple. He wasn't choosing between two schools. He was trying to discover who he was. And that question doesn't yield to pro/con lists.

Arjuna's honesty in 3.2 is a gift. It says: You are allowed to still be confused even after seeking guidance. You are allowed to ask again. Clarity sometimes arrives in layers, not lightning bolts.

And then Krishna reveals something that reframes the entire problem:

"The Supreme Lord is situated in everyone's heart, O Arjuna, and is directing the wanderings of all living entities, who are seated as on a machine, made of the material energy."

-- Bhagavad-gita 18.61

The Supreme Lord is situated in everyone's heart. Including Jordan's. Including yours.

This means the guidance Jordan is seeking isn't only available from his mother, his friend, his girlfriend, or a pro/con list. It's available from within. The director of all wanderings is already present, already situated, already offering direction--if Jordan can get quiet enough to hear it beneath the noise of everyone else's certainty.

This doesn't mean "follow your gut" in the pop-psychology sense. It means there is a source of knowing deeper than the mind's endless deliberation. The confusion arises because Jordan is trying to solve a spiritual question with intellectual tools. He's asking his brain to tell him who he is, when his brain is part of the machinery, not the driver.


Living the Teaching: The Practice of Surrendered Inquiry

"Great," Jordan mutters. "So God is in my heart directing my wanderings. How does that help me by Friday?"

Here's what shifts:

When you stop asking "What should I choose?" and start asking "What is being asked of me?"--different answers emerge. Not from the noise. From the quiet.

Practice Box: The Confusion-Dissolving Practice

When you're paralyzed by choice:

1. Stop gathering more information

You have enough. More data won't cure confusion--it'll deepen it. Close the laptop. Stop asking opinions.

2. Admit confusion honestly, as Arjuna did

"I don't know. I've lost my composure. I need help." This is not weakness. This is the prerequisite for wisdom.

3. Get quiet enough to hear what's beneath the noise

Sit for twenty minutes. Not to find an answer. To stop drowning in everyone else's answers. The director of all wanderings is already in your heart. But you can't hear a whisper when everyone is shouting.

4. Ask the deeper question

Not "Which is better?" but "Which choice is being asked of me? Which path makes me more myself, not less?"

Your body often knows before your mind does. When you imagine one path, does your chest open or contract? The body doesn't lie the way the mind does.


The Way Forward: Choosing From Clarity

Jordan closes his laptop. Stops reading reviews. Stops asking opinions.

He sits in silence for twenty minutes. Just breathing. Watching thoughts arise and pass.

And in that stillness, something clarifies.

Not as a voice. Not as certainty. Just as a quiet knowing--the kind of knowing that doesn't argue because it doesn't need to.

He picks up his phone. Opens the email to Berklee. Types: "I accept."

His hand shakes as he hits send. Fear floods in immediately. "What are you doing? You're throwing away Stanford! You're being irresponsible!"

But underneath the fear, there's something else. Something that feels like relief. Like coming home to a self he'd been leaving outside in the cold.

He calls his mom.

"I chose Berklee."

Silence on the other end. Then: "But Stanford--"

"I know, Mom. I know. But I can't be who you want and who I am at the same time. And I need to find out who I am."

More silence. Then, quieter: "Are you sure?"

"No. But I'm clear. And that's better than sure."

Three years later, Jordan sits in his dorm room at Berklee, finishing a composition that weaves neuroscience concepts into musical structure. His professor called it "the most original synthesis I've seen in twenty years."

He didn't have to choose between scientist and musician. He just had to stop asking which one he was and start listening to what wanted to emerge through him.

The confusion wasn't about the choice. It was about trusting that the director of all wanderings--situated in his heart, directing his path--knew something his pro/con list didn't.

That knowing doesn't shout. It whispers.

You just have to get quiet enough to hear it.


Reflection

- What choice are you avoiding because you're trying to be certain instead of clear?
- Can you admit your confusion honestly, the way Arjuna did, without treating it as failure?
- What would you hear if you stopped listening to everyone else's answers and sat in silence with your own?
