# Chapter 46: Spirituality

## Sunday Morning

Jamal watches his grandmother dress for church.

She's ninety-two. Moves slowly. But every Sunday, without fail, she's ready by 8 AM.

"Grandma, you don't have to go if you're tired," he says.

She looks at him like he's spoken nonsense. "Baby, this isn't about tired. This is about feeding my soul."

Jamal nods. Doesn't argue.

But he doesn't understand.

He stopped going to church at sixteen. Stopped believing at nineteen. Now, at thirty-four, he considers himself spiritual but not religious.

Which, he's realizing, might mean nothing at all.

He meditates sometimes. Reads books about mindfulness. Listens to podcasts about consciousness. Believes in "something bigger."

But what does that actually mean?

His grandmother has a practice. A community. A tradition that shapes her life.

Jamal has... thoughts. Ideas. Vibes.

Is that spirituality? Or is it just consumption dressed up as seeking?

Later, after he drops her at church, Jamal goes to his favorite coffee shop. Opens his laptop. Scrolls through his reading list: "The Power of Now." "Be Here Now." "The Untethered Soul."

All unfinished.

He's been seeking for fifteen years.

What, exactly, is he seeking?

## The Spiritual Marketplace

We live in the age of spiritual tourism.

Sample Buddhism here. Try yoga there. A bit of Stoicism. Some mindfulness. A podcast on transcendence. A retreat on awakening.

Collect it all. Synthesize nothing.

It feels like seeking. Like being open. Like staying curious.

But maybe it's just avoidance.

Avoidance of commitment. Of discipline. Of actually submitting to a path that might demand something uncomfortable.

Jamal has attended workshops on chakras, breathwork, manifestation, energy healing. He's read the Tao Te Ching, the Dhammapada, the Yoga Sutras.

But he's never committed to any of it long enough to let it change him.

He's a spiritual dilettante. Sampling everything. Mastering nothing.

His grandmother, meanwhile, has practiced one thing—Christian devotion—for seventy-five years.

She prays every morning. Reads her Bible. Serves her church. Loves her neighbors. Forgives her enemies.

Simple. Consistent. Transformative.

Jamal has more spiritual knowledge in his podcast app than she's encountered in her lifetime.

But she has something he doesn't: actual spiritual life.

Not ideas about God. Relationship with God.

Not theories about love. Embodied love.

Not podcasts about presence. Actual presence.

Spirituality isn't what you know. It's how you live.

And Jamal, for all his seeking, isn't living any differently than he was fifteen years ago.

## The Gītā Speaks: The Path of Commitment

The Bhagavad-gītā doesn't offer spirituality as a menu. It offers it as a marriage.

You choose a path. You commit. You practice. You transform.

> ``Of all yogīs, the one with great faith who always abides in Me, thinks of Me within himself, and renders transcendental loving service to Me—he is the most intimately united with Me in yoga and is the highest of all. That is My opinion.''
>
> --- Bhagavad-gītā 6.47

**Great faith.** Not tentative curiosity. Not intellectual interest. Faith—deep trust that leads to commitment.

**Always abides in Me.** Not when it's convenient. Not when it feels good. Always.

**Renders transcendental loving service.** This isn't passive. It's active devotion. A way of life.

**Most intimately united... highest of all.** The highest spiritual attainment isn't having the most knowledge. It's having the deepest practice.

Later, Kṛṣṇa warns against exactly what Jamal's doing:

> ``But those who worship demigods will take birth among the demigods; those who worship the ancestors go to the ancestors; those who worship ghosts and spirits will take birth among such beings; and those who worship Me will live with Me.''
>
> --- Bhagavad-gītā 9.25

**You become what you worship.** Not what you read about. Not what you're curious about. What you actually give yourself to.

Jamal worships comfort. Novelty. The feeling of seeking without the discomfort of finding.

And he's becoming exactly that: comfortable, distracted, and permanently unfulfilled.

Real spirituality isn't about options. It's about choice.

Choose a path. Walk it. Let it transform you.

Or don't choose. And spend your life browsing.

## Living the Teaching: Choosing Your Path

Jamal picks up his grandmother from church.

"How was service?" he asks.

"Powerful," she says. "Pastor spoke on forgiveness. Really convicted me about holding grudges."

Jamal glances at her. "You? You don't hold grudges."

"Oh baby, I do," she laughs. "I've been mad at Sister Patricia for three years over a comment she made. Today, I realized I need to let it go."

"So you will?"

"Already did. Called her during fellowship hour. We cried. We prayed. It's done."

Jamal marvels at this. The speed. The directness. The transformation.

"How do you do that?" he asks. "Just... apply the teaching immediately?"

She looks at him. "That's what spirituality is, baby. Not thinking about it. Doing it."

"But what if you don't know what to do?"

"Then you ask God. You read the Word. You talk to your community. You pray. And then you act. You don't need to figure it all out first. You just need to take the next faithful step."

Jamal thinks about his bookshelf. His podcast queue. His endless reading list.

All those paths. None chosen.

"Grandma," he says quietly, "I think I'm lost."

She pats his hand. "You're not lost, baby. You're just standing at the crossroads trying to walk every direction at once. Pick one. Walk it. God will meet you there."

### Practice Box

**The Practice of Committed Spirituality**

**1. Choose your path.** Study broadly if you must. But commit deeply to one tradition, one practice, one relationship with the Divine. Depth beats breadth.

**2. Find a community.** Spirituality isn't solo. It's communal. Find people who are walking your path. Learn from them. Serve with them.

**3. Practice daily.** Not when you feel inspired. Daily. Build the ritual. Prayer. Meditation. Study. Service. Make it non-negotiable.

**4. Apply immediately.** When you learn something, do it. Don't just add it to your mental collection. Let it change your behavior today.

**5. Stay the course.** You'll get bored. You'll be tempted by other paths. Stay. Depth comes from commitment, not variety.

Jamal starts going to church with his grandmother.

Not because he suddenly believes everything she believes. But because he needs to stop browsing and start practicing.

The first few weeks are uncomfortable. The theology doesn't all fit. Some of the music feels outdated. The rituals seem strange.

But he stays.

And slowly, something shifts.

Not his beliefs, necessarily. His being.

There's something about showing up. About singing with others. About hearing ancient words read aloud. About praying for people who need help.

It's not intellectual. It's participatory.

He's not studying spirituality anymore. He's living it.

One Sunday, after service, an older man approaches him. "You're Mama Joyce's grandson, right?"

"Yes sir."

"She's been praying for you to come back to church for years. Talks about you all the time."

Jamal's throat tightens. "I didn't know."

"Oh yes. Every prayer meeting. 'Lord, bring my Jamal home.' Well, here you are."

Jamal looks across the room at his grandmother. She's talking to Sister Patricia. Both of them laughing.

She lived her spirituality. Prayed. Loved. Forgave. Served.

While he collected ideas, she embodied truth.

While he browsed paths, she walked one.

While he sought spirituality, she was spiritual.

And her life—her actual, lived, embodied life—was the sermon that finally reached him.

## The Way Forward: The Embodied Path

A year later, Jamal is still going to church.

He's joined the volunteer team. Helps with community meals. Participates in Bible study.

A friend asks, "So you're Christian now?"

Jamal thinks about it. "I'm... learning to be. I'm practicing Christianity. Not perfectly. But consistently."

"I thought you were spiritual but not religious?"

"I was," Jamal says. "Which turned out to be neither. Now I'm trying to actually be both. Spiritual because I'm religious. Religious because I'm committed."

"What changed?"

"I stopped collecting spirituality and started living it. Chose a path. Found a community. Made a practice. And it's transforming me in ways reading never did."

Because spirituality isn't a concept. It's a commitment.

It's not about having the right ideas. It's about living the right life.

A life of devotion. Of service. Of love. Of faith.

You don't think your way into spirituality. You practice your way into it.

You choose a path. You walk it. You let it change you.

And one day, you realize: you're not seeking anymore.

You've found.

Not all the answers. But the path.

And the path—walked faithfully, daily, humbly—is enough.

## Reflection

- Are you collecting spiritual ideas or committing to spiritual practice? What paths have you sampled without ever walking deeply?
- What would it mean to choose one tradition, one practice, one path—and commit to it for a year? What scares you about that commitment?
- Is your spirituality changing how you live, or just how you think? What would embodied spirituality look like in your daily life—today, right now?
