# Chapter 14: Greed

## The Hunger That Never Fills

Rachel remembers when $100,000 felt like wealth.

She was twenty-eight, just promoted to senior analyst, and that first six-figure salary felt transformative. /This is it,/ she thought. /This is enough./

It wasn't.

Within six months, the lifestyle adjusted. Better apartment. Nicer car. Restaurants she would have considered absurd extravagance a year before became normal Tuesday nights. The $100,000 became baseline. Necessary. Barely comfortable.

When she made partner at thirty-four, the number jumped to $250,000. Again, that feeling: /Now. Now this is enough./

It lasted maybe three months.

Now, at forty-one, Rachel makes $680,000 a year. Her portfolio is worth $2.3 million. She has the apartment, the car, the wardrobe, the vacations. Everything she once thought would mean she'd "made it."

And she's looking at a job posting for a position that would pay $850,000.

She doesn't need it. Doesn't even want the job particularly—more stress, longer hours, less time for the life she already barely lives. But the number pulls at her.

Because what if $850,000 is the threshold? What if /that's/ the amount where the hunger finally stops?

Deep down, she knows the truth.

There is no threshold.

The hunger doesn't stop at any number. It just adjusts. Adapts. Always hungry. Never filled.

This is greed. Not the cartoon villain hoarding gold. But the quiet, constant sense that /more/ will finally be /enough/—even though it never has been before.

## The Lie of "Just a Little More"

Greed isn't about wanting things.

It's about believing that having more things will satisfy the want. That acquisition leads to contentment. That there's a finish line somewhere ahead where you'll finally have enough and the hunger will stop.

But here's what actually happens:

You get the thing. The raise. The house. The car. The achievement. The recognition. And for a brief moment—hours, days, maybe weeks—you feel satisfied.

Then the baseline shifts.

What was once extraordinary becomes ordinary. What was once "more than enough" becomes barely sufficient. And the hunger returns, now aiming at something even further away.

Psychologists call this the "hedonic treadmill." No matter how much you acquire, your happiness returns to baseline. You adapt. And then you want more.

The Bhagavad-gītā calls it something else: /lobha/. Greed. The insatiable desire for acquisition that can never be satisfied because it's not actually about the objects you're pursuing.

It's about trying to fill an internal emptiness with external things.

And that never works.

Because the emptiness isn't a lack of money, possessions, status, or achievement. It's a disconnection from your essential self—the eternal consciousness that is already complete, already whole, already enough.

But greed doesn't know that. Greed thinks the next acquisition will do it. The next milestone. The next number.

Just a little more. Then I'll be happy. Then I'll be safe. Then I'll be enough.

The lie is seductive because it contains a truth: you /do/ feel better when you acquire something new. Briefly. And that brief satisfaction tricks you into thinking more acquisition equals lasting satisfaction.

But it doesn't. It never has. And it never will.

Because you're trying to satisfy a spiritual hunger with material food.

## The Gītā Speaks: The Doorway to Destruction

Kṛṣṇa doesn't condemn material prosperity.

Nowhere in the Gītā does he say, "Be poor. Reject wealth. Live in deprivation." What he condemns is the /attachment/ to wealth—the belief that having more will make you more.

He names greed as one of three gates to hell:

> ``There are three gates leading to this hell—lust, anger and greed. Every sane man should give these up, for they lead to the degradation of the soul.''
>
> --- Bhagavad-gītā 16.21

Lust. Anger. Greed.

Notice they're linked. Lust is desire for pleasure. Anger is desire thwarted. Greed is desire insatiable—the craving that no amount of satisfaction can quench.

And Kṛṣṇa says these lead to "degradation of the soul." Not in some metaphorical afterlife, but here, now, in this life. When you're ruled by greed, you degrade yourself. You reduce your infinite nature to a hungry ghost, always consuming, never full.

Earlier, he describes what happens to those consumed by greed:

> ``Those who are demoniac do not know what is to be done and what is not to be done. Neither cleanliness nor proper behavior nor truth is found in them... Following such conclusions, the demoniac, who are lost to themselves and who have no intelligence, engage in unbeneficial, horrible works meant to destroy the world.''
>
> --- Bhagavad-gītā 16.7, 9

"Lost to themselves."

That's the key phrase. Greed makes you forget who you actually are. You think you're the accumulation—the net worth, the possessions, the status. And so you spend your life trying to increase the accumulation, thinking you're increasing yourself.

But you're not the accumulation.

You're the eternal self. The consciousness. The witness. And that self doesn't increase with acquisition. It's already complete.

One more verse:

> ``The material desire is never satisfied and grows more and more, like fire... This lust which the demons worship is insatiable.''
>
> --- Bhagavad-gītā (Purport to 16.12)

Like fire. Feed it, and it grows. The more you acquire, the more you want.

The only way to stop the hunger isn't to finally acquire enough. It's to stop feeding the fire. To recognize that what you're actually hungry for can't be purchased, achieved, or accumulated.

It can only be remembered.

## Living the Teaching: Enough as Practice

Rachel doesn't apply for the $850,000 job.

Not because she's conquered greed. But because she's started asking a different question.

Instead of /How much do I need to feel enough?/ she asks: /What if I'm already enough?/

It sounds simple. Almost trite. But when she sits with it—really sits with it—it's revolutionary.

She makes a list one evening. Not of what she wants, but of what she /has/.

Enough money to live comfortably. Enough food to eat well. Enough shelter to be safe. Enough clothing to be warm. Enough health to function. Enough time to rest.

Actually—more than enough.

She has surplus. Significant surplus.

And yet the hunger persists. Not for /things/ she needs, but for /more/—as if more itself were the point.

She tries an experiment.

For one month, she doesn't acquire anything new. No new clothes. No new gadgets. No upgrades. No impulse purchases. If something breaks, she replaces it. If she needs something, she gets it. But nothing beyond need.

The first week is uncomfortable. She feels deprived. Notices how often she thinks /I should get that/ or /I deserve this/.

But then something shifts.

By week three, the constant background hum of wanting starts to quiet. Not gone. But softer.

And in that quiet, she notices something she's been too busy to feel:

She has enough. More than enough. She /is/ enough.

Not because of what she has, but because of what she is: the eternal self, witnessing this life, experiencing this moment, complete in her essential nature regardless of external circumstances.

The greed hasn't disappeared. But she's no longer enslaved to it.

She can feel the hunger arise, acknowledge it, and choose not to feed it.

And in that choice, she discovers something more satisfying than any acquisition:

Freedom.

### Practice Box

**The Practice of Enough**

1. **Name what you have.** Make a list. Be specific. What do you already possess? What needs are already met? Let yourself see the sufficiency that greed blinds you to.

2. **Notice the hunger.** When does the voice of ``more'' arise? After scrolling social media? Comparing yourself to others? Feeling bored or empty? Identify the trigger.

3. **Ask: What am I actually hungry for?** Is it the new car, or is it the feeling you think the new car will give you? Is it the promotion, or the validation? Name the real hunger. Often it's not material.

4. **Practice non-acquisition.** For one week (or one day, if a week feels impossible), don't buy anything beyond genuine necessity. Notice what happens. Does the hunger intensify? Fade? Reveal itself as habit rather than need?

5. **Remember your completeness.** You are the eternal self. Already whole. Already enough. Acquisition doesn't add to you. It just adds to your possessions. And those are temporary. You're not.

Greed promises satisfaction. But only remembering your true nature delivers it.

## The Way Forward: Freedom From the Hunger

Two years later, Rachel turns down another offer.

This one would have made her a millionaire many times over—equity in a startup, high risk but potentially transformative wealth.

Her younger self would have taken it without thinking. More money = more security = more worth.

But this Rachel knows better.

She doesn't turn it down because she's ascetic or anti-wealth. She turns it down because she's clear about her values: time with her partner, creative work that matters to her, the ability to sleep at night without the stress of high-stakes gambling.

The money would have come at a cost. And she's no longer willing to pay that cost for the promise of "more."

She has enough. Financially. Materially. And more importantly—existentially.

She is enough. Not because of what she's accumulated, but because of what she is: consciousness itself, eternally complete, requiring nothing external to validate her worth.

The hunger still visits sometimes. Old habits die hard. She'll see someone's success and feel the familiar pang: /I should have that. I deserve that./

But now she recognizes it for what it is: not truth, but greed. The voice that promises satisfaction through acquisition and has never, ever delivered.

She acknowledges it. Watches it. Lets it pass.

And returns to what's actually here: this moment, this breath, this life that is—already, always—enough.

The fire of greed doesn't consume her anymore.

Not because she extinguished it through deprivation.

But because she stopped feeding it with the belief that more would ever be enough.

And in that stopping, she found what greed had been promising all along:

Contentment. Peace. Sufficiency.

Not from having everything.

But from recognizing she already is everything she needs to be.

## Reflection

- What's your "enough" number? And when you reach it, do you think the hunger will actually stop?
- What are you actually hungry for beneath the desire for more money, status, or possessions?
- What would change if you believed you were already enough, regardless of what you acquire?
