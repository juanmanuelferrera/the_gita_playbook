Chapter 14: Greed

The Hunger That Never Fills

Rachel remembers when $100,000 felt like wealth.

She was twenty-eight, just promoted to senior analyst, and that first six-figure salary felt transformative. This is it, she thought. This is enough.

It wasn't.

Within six months, the lifestyle adjusted. Better apartment. Nicer car. Restaurants she would have considered absurd extravagance a year before became normal Tuesday nights. The $100,000 became baseline. Necessary. Barely comfortable.

When she made partner at thirty-four, the number jumped to $250,000. Again, that feeling: Now. Now this is enough.

It lasted maybe three months.

Now, at forty-one, Rachel makes $680,000 a year. Her portfolio is worth $2.3 million. She has the apartment, the car, the wardrobe, the vacations. Everything she once thought would mean she'd "made it."

And she's looking at a job posting for a position that would pay $850,000.

She doesn't need it. Doesn't even want the job particularly -- more stress, longer hours, less time for the life she already barely lives. But the number pulls at her.

Because what if $850,000 is the threshold? What if that's the amount where the hunger finally stops?

Deep down, she knows the truth. There is no threshold. The hunger doesn't stop at any number. It just adjusts. Adapts. Always hungry. Never filled.


Reflective Bridge

Greed isn't about wanting things. It's about believing that having more things will satisfy the want. That acquisition leads to contentment. That there's a finish line somewhere ahead where you'll finally have enough and the hunger will stop.

But here's what actually happens: you get the thing -- the raise, the house, the car, the achievement. And for a brief moment you feel satisfied. Then the baseline shifts. What was once extraordinary becomes ordinary. What was once "more than enough" becomes barely sufficient. And the hunger returns, now aiming at something even further away.

The Bhagavad-gita calls it lobha -- greed. The insatiable desire for acquisition that can never be satisfied because it's not actually about the objects you're pursuing. It's about trying to fill an internal emptiness with external things.

And that never works. Because the emptiness isn't a lack of money, possessions, or status. It's a disconnection from your essential self -- the eternal consciousness that is already complete, already whole, already enough.

But greed doesn't know that. Greed thinks the next acquisition will do it. The next milestone. The next number.

Just a little more. Then I'll be happy. Then I'll be safe. Then I'll be enough.


The Gita Speaks: The Three Gates and the Three Modes

Krishna names greed as one of three gates to destruction:

  "There are three gates leading to this hell -- lust, anger, and greed. Every sane man should give these up, for they lead to the degradation of the soul."

  -- Bhagavad-gita 16.21

Lust. Anger. Greed. Notice they're linked. Lust is desire for pleasure. Anger is desire thwarted. Greed is desire insatiable -- the craving that no amount of satisfaction can quench. And Krishna says these lead to "degradation of the soul." Not in some metaphorical afterlife, but here, now, in this life. When you're ruled by greed, you reduce your infinite nature to a hungry ghost -- always consuming, never full.

Rachel makes $680,000 and feels poor. Not financially poor. Existentially poor. That's degradation -- not of her bank account, but of her capacity to experience sufficiency.

But why does greed take hold so completely? Krishna explains the mechanism:

  "From the mode of goodness, real knowledge develops; from the mode of passion, grief develops; and from the mode of ignorance, foolishness, madness and illusion develop."

  -- Bhagavad-gita 14.17

Three modes govern human consciousness. When goodness prevails, you see clearly -- you recognize what's enough, what truly satisfies. When passion dominates, you chase and acquire, and the result is grief -- the hollow feeling Rachel knows well after every raise that fails to satisfy. When ignorance rules, you can't even see what you're doing. You accumulate blindly, confusing quantity with quality, possessions with peace.

Rachel's greed isn't evil. It's passion -- the mode that drives restless activity, acquisition, and the endless pursuit of more. And as Krishna says plainly, the fruit of passion is grief. Not satisfaction. Grief.

So what's the way out? Not more acquisition. Not even the renunciation of all possessions. Something deeper:

  "One should perform sacrifice, penance and charity with the word tat. The purpose of such transcendental activities is to get free from the material entanglement."

  -- Bhagavad-gita 17.25

Tat -- "that," meaning the Absolute, the transcendent purpose beyond personal gain. The antidote to greed isn't deprivation. It's redirection. Instead of acquiring for yourself, you act for something beyond yourself. Sacrifice. Penance. Charity. Not as guilt offerings, but as a shift in orientation -- from "What can I get?" to "What can I give?"

When Rachel earns for herself, no amount is enough. But when earning becomes an instrument of contribution -- charity, service, support -- the relationship to money transforms. The number stops being a measure of her worth and becomes a tool for her purpose.


Living the Teaching

Rachel doesn't apply for the $850,000 job.

Not because she's conquered greed. But because she's started asking a different question.

Instead of How much do I need to feel enough? she asks: What if I'm already enough?

It sounds simple. Almost trite. But when she sits with it -- really sits with it -- it's revolutionary.

She makes a list one evening. Not of what she wants, but of what she has. Enough money to live comfortably. Enough food to eat well. Enough shelter to be safe. Enough health to function.

Actually -- more than enough. She has surplus. Significant surplus. And yet the hunger persists. Not for things she needs, but for more -- as if more itself were the point.

She tries an experiment. For one month, she doesn't acquire anything new. No new clothes. No new gadgets. No upgrades. No impulse purchases. If something breaks, she replaces it. If she needs something, she gets it. But nothing beyond need.

The first week is uncomfortable. She feels deprived. Notices how often she thinks I should get that or I deserve this. The mode of passion screaming for activity.

But then something shifts.

By week three, the constant background hum of wanting starts to quiet. Not gone. But softer. And in that quiet, she notices something she's been too busy acquiring to feel: she has enough. She is enough.

She begins redirecting. Not dramatically -- she doesn't sell everything and move to an ashram. But she starts giving. Systematically. Deliberately. A percentage of every paycheck to causes she cares about. Time to people who need it. Attention to work that serves something beyond her own advancement.

And something unexpected happens: the giving satisfies in a way that getting never did. Not because giving is morally superior. But because it breaks the cycle -- the closed loop of earn-acquire-want more that passion creates.

The mode of goodness, Krishna said, produces real knowledge. And the knowledge Rachel is discovering is this: she was never actually hungry for money. She was hungry for meaning. And meaning comes not from accumulation but from contribution.


Practice Box

1. Name what you have. Make a list. Be specific. What do you already possess? What needs are already met? Let yourself see the sufficiency that greed blinds you to.

2. Identify the mode. Is your desire coming from goodness (clear seeing), passion (restless craving), or ignorance (blind accumulation)? The mode of passion produces grief, not satisfaction. Recognizing which mode is driving you is the first step to changing it.

3. Redirect from getting to giving. The antidote to greed isn't deprivation -- it's purposeful generosity. Give something this week. Money, time, attention. Not to feel virtuous. But to break the cycle of acquisition.

4. Practice non-acquisition. For one week, don't buy anything beyond genuine necessity. Notice what happens. Does the hunger intensify? Fade? Reveal itself as habit rather than need?


The Way Forward

Two years later, Rachel turns down another offer.

This one would have made her a millionaire many times over -- equity in a startup, high risk but potentially transformative wealth.

Her younger self would have taken it without thinking. More money = more security = more worth.

But this Rachel knows better.

She doesn't turn it down because she's ascetic or anti-wealth. She turns it down because she's clear about her values: time with her partner, creative work that matters to her, the ability to sleep at night without the stress of high-stakes gambling.

The money would have come at a cost. And she's no longer willing to pay that cost for the promise of "more."

She has enough. Financially. Materially. And more importantly -- existentially.

The hunger still visits sometimes. Old habits die hard. She'll see someone's success and feel the familiar pang: I should have that. I deserve that. The mode of passion, pulling.

But now she recognizes it for what it is: not truth, but greed. One of three gates Krishna warned about. She acknowledges it. Watches it. Lets it pass.

And returns to what's actually here: this moment, this breath, this life that is -- already, always -- enough.

The fire of greed doesn't consume her anymore. Not because she extinguished it through deprivation. But because she stopped feeding it with the belief that more would ever be enough.

And in that stopping, she found what greed had been promising all along: contentment. Peace. Sufficiency.

Not from having everything. But from recognizing she already is everything she needs to be.


Reflection

- What's your "enough" number? And when you reach it, do you think the hunger will actually stop?
- Which mode is driving your desire for more -- goodness, passion, or ignorance? What fruit is it producing?
- What would change if you redirected even a fraction of your acquiring energy toward giving?
