Chapter 57: Life Cycle

Opening Story

The baby arrives at 3:42 AM.

Sarah holds her daughter for the first time and feels the weight. Not just physical weight. The weight of a new life beginning.

Where did you come from?

The question is not rhetorical. Sarah genuinely wonders: this consciousness now looking at her with unfocused eyes--where was it yesterday? Last week? Last year? Did it exist before this body? Will it continue after?

The baby grips Sarah's finger. And Sarah understands with sudden clarity: she is witnessing a beginning. Not the beginning--but a beginning. One more turn in a cycle that has been spinning long before this moment and will continue long after.

Twenty-five years later, that baby--now named Emma--sits across from Sarah at dinner, talking about her new job. Her apartment. Her plans. Sarah watches and sees: summer. The growth phase. Energy. Ambition. Expansion.

Sarah is sixty-eight when she feels it unmistakably: autumn. Not old age yet. But the shift from expansion to contraction. Her body does not recover as quickly. Her ambitions change. No longer about building--but about completing. Finishing what matters. Releasing what does not.

"Aren't you sad?" Emma asks, now forty-three with children of her own.

"Not sad. Just different. I don't need as much anymore."

Reflective Bridge

Most people fight the cycle. They try to stay in summer forever. Anti-aging. Productivity hacks. The desperate attempt to maintain expansion when contraction is calling.

But what if the cycle is not the enemy? What if it is the design?

Birth. Growth. Maturity. Decline. Death. Then birth again.

Not just across lifetimes--but within this one. Every day: waking, activity, evening, sleep. Every project: initiation, expansion, completion, release. Every relationship: meeting, deepening, changing, sometimes ending.

The cycle repeats at every scale. Fighting it creates suffering. Flowing with it creates grace.

And the force behind this cycle is not blind. It is not random. It has a source.

The Gita Speaks: The Source of All Cycles

Krishna reveals Himself as both origin and end:

"All created beings have their origin in these two natures. From all that is material and from all that is spiritual in this world, know with all certainty that I am both the origin and the dissolution."
-- Bhagavad-gita 7.6

Every cycle--every birth and death, every spring and winter, every beginning and ending--originates in the divine and returns to the divine. The cycle is not purposeless machinery. It is the breathing of God.

And where does the life within the cycle come from?

"I am the source of all spiritual and material worlds. Everything emanates from Me."
-- Bhagavad-gita 10.8

The energy propelling Sarah through her seasons, the force that brought Emma into being, the consciousness animating every living thing--all of it flows from a single source.

And that source governs both creation and completion:

"I am the all-devouring death, and I am the generating principle of all that is to exist."
-- Bhagavad-gita 10.34

Death is not the enemy of life. It is the other half of the same cycle. The same divine energy that generates also dissolves. Spring and winter are not opponents. They are partners in the rhythm of existence.

Living the Teaching

Sarah's eightieth birthday arrives. Three generations gather. Her grandchildren are in their summer--energy, plans, possibilities.

Sarah watches them with deep affection. She remembers that energy. That certainty. That hunger.

She does not envy it. She is in winter now. Not depressed. Not resigned. Just winter. The body is slowing. Sleep comes earlier. She walks instead of runs.

But something else is emerging: clarity. With fewer years ahead than behind, what matters becomes obvious. Not achievement. Not accumulation. Connection. Presence. Love.

"How do you feel about turning eighty?" Emma asks quietly.

Sarah smiles.

"Grateful."

"For what?"

"For having lived long enough to see all the seasons."

Spring: when everything was new and overwhelming. Summer: when she built her career, raised Emma, created a life. Autumn: when she released what no longer served and focused on what mattered. Winter: now. The culmination. The completion before the next beginning.

Practice Box

1. Identify which season you are in. Not just your age--but where you are in any cycle. Career? Relationship? Creative project? Are you in spring, summer, autumn, or winter? Each phase has different needs.

2. Stop fighting your season. If you are in autumn, do not force summer's energy. If you are in spring, do not expect autumn's wisdom. Honor where you actually are.

3. Notice the cycles within cycles. Every day has seasons. Every year. Every project. Practice recognizing the rhythm at all scales.

4. Remember: winter is not the end. After winter comes spring. After death comes birth. The cycle continues. Rest in that continuity instead of clinging to any single phase.

The Way Forward

Sarah is ninety-two when she feels it clearly: the transition. Winter moving toward its end.

Emma visits, now seventy herself.

"Are you scared?" Emma asks, holding her mother's hand.

Sarah shakes her head.

"I've lived a full cycle. Birth to death. I've seen how the rhythm works."

"And after?"

Sarah smiles.

"After winter comes spring."

She can feel it--the way autumn trees feel the coming winter, the way seeds feel the coming spring. The transition. The completion. The continuation.

I am both the origin and the dissolution.

The rhythm eternal. Sarah rests in it. Completely.

Reflection

- Which season are you in right now? In your life? In your career? In your relationships? Can you honor where you actually are instead of where you think you should be?
- What are you fighting that wants to change? Are you clinging to summer when autumn is calling? What would it mean to stop resisting and flow with your actual season?
- Can you see the cycles within cycles? Every day, every year, every project has its own rhythm of beginning, expansion, completion, and rest. What if the cycle is not the enemy but the teacher?
