# Chapter 57: Life Cycle

## Spring: Birth

The baby arrives at 3:42 AM.

Sarah holds her daughter for the first time and feels the weight.

Not just physical weight.

The weight of a new life beginning.

Completely dependent. Completely vulnerable. Completely new.

*Where did you come from?*

The question isn't rhetorical. Sarah genuinely wonders:

This consciousness now looking at her with unfocused eyes—where was it yesterday? Last week? Last year?

Did it exist before this body?

Will it continue after?

The baby grips Sarah's finger.

And Sarah understands with sudden clarity:

She's witnessing a beginning.

Not the beginning—but *a* beginning.

One more turn in a cycle that's been spinning long before this moment and will continue long after.

## Summer: Growth

Twenty-five years later, that baby—now named Emma—sits across from Sarah at dinner.

Emma is talking about her new job. Her apartment. Her plans.

Sarah watches and sees: *summer*.

The growth phase.

Energy. Ambition. Expansion.

Emma is building. Creating. Becoming.

Everything feels possible.

"I want to travel," Emma says. "See everything. Do everything."

Sarah smiles.

She remembers this phase.

The intoxication of capability. The belief that time is infinite. The hunger to experience, achieve, accumulate.

"You will," Sarah says.

She doesn't add what she's learned:

That summer doesn't last.

That the very energy propelling Emma forward will eventually...slow.

Not yet. Not for years.

But eventually.

Because that's the cycle.

## Autumn: Decline

Sarah is sixty-eight when she feels it unmistakably:

Autumn.

Not old age. Not yet.

But the shift from expansion to contraction.

Her body doesn't recover as quickly. Injuries linger. Energy wanes by evening.

Her ambitions change. No longer about building—but about completing. Finishing what matters. Releasing what doesn't.

She retires.

Sells the house she raised Emma in.

Moves somewhere smaller, simpler.

"Aren't you sad?" Emma asks, now forty-three with children of her own.

Sarah considers.

"Not sad. Just... different. I don't need as much anymore. The house served its purpose. Now it's someone else's summer."

Emma doesn't understand yet.

She's still in her own summer—busy, building, expanding.

But she will.

Because the cycle turns for everyone.

## Understanding the Wheel

Most people fight the cycle.

They try to stay in summer forever.

Anti-aging. Productivity hacks. The desperate attempt to maintain expansion when contraction is calling.

Or they collapse into autumn prematurely.

Give up. Resign. Treat aging like defeat instead of transition.

But what if the cycle isn't the enemy?

What if it's the design?

Birth. Growth. Maturity. Decline. Death.

Then... birth again.

Not just across lifetimes—but within this one.

Every day: waking (birth), activity (growth), evening (decline), sleep (death).

Every project: initiation, expansion, completion, release.

Every relationship: meeting, deepening, changing, sometimes ending.

The cycle repeats.

At every scale.

Fighting it creates suffering.

Flowing with it creates grace.

## The Gītā Speaks: Accept All Seasons

Kṛṣṇa tells Arjuna early in the Gītā:

> ``O son of Kuntī, the nonpermanent appearance of happiness and distress, and their disappearance in due course, are like the appearance and disappearance of winter and summer seasons. They arise from sense perception, and one must learn to tolerate them without being disturbed.''
>
> --- Bhagavad-gītā 2.14

Seasons come. Seasons go.

Winter doesn't last. Neither does summer.

The appearance of strength (summer) is temporary.

The appearance of decline (autumn/winter) is temporary.

Both are phases in a cycle.

Later, Kṛṣṇa reveals something deeper:

> ``At the beginning of Brahmā's day, all living entities become manifest from the unmanifest state, and thereafter, when the night falls, they are merged into the unmanifest again.''
>
> --- Bhagavad-gītā 8.18

Even the cosmos breathes.

Manifestation and dissolution.

Creation and absorption.

Day and night at the scale of the universe.

You're part of that rhythm.

Fighting it is like waves fighting the tide.

Flowing with it—accepting spring's growth, summer's expansion, autumn's release, winter's rest—that's wisdom.

## Living the Teaching: Honoring the Season You're In

Sarah's eightieth birthday arrives.

Emma, now fifty-five and in her own autumn, organizes a party.

Three generations gather. Sarah's grandchildren—Emma's kids—are in their summer. Energy. Plans. Possibilities.

Sarah watches them with deep affection.

She remembers that energy. That certainty. That hunger.

She doesn't envy it.

She's in winter now.

Not depressed. Not resigned. Just... winter.

The body is slowing. Sleep comes earlier. She walks instead of runs.

But something else is emerging:

Clarity.

With fewer years ahead than behind, what matters becomes obvious.

Not achievement. Not accumulation.

Connection. Presence. Love.

She spends less time doing.

More time being.

"How do you feel about turning eighty?" Emma asks quietly.

Sarah smiles.

"Grateful."

"For what?"

"For having lived long enough to see all the seasons."

Spring: when everything was new and overwhelming.

Summer: when she built her career, raised Emma, created a life.

Autumn: when she released what no longer served and focused on what mattered.

Winter: now. The culmination. The completion before the next beginning.

"I used to fight getting older," Sarah admits. "Tried to stay in summer. But each season has its gifts."

"What's winter's gift?"

Sarah considers.

"Perspective. Acceptance. The knowledge that the cycle is perfect exactly as it is."

### Practice Box

**The Practice of Honoring Life's Seasons**

\begin{enumerate}
\item **Identify which season you're in.** Not just your age—but where you are in any cycle. Career? Relationship? Creative project? Are you in spring (beginning), summer (expansion), autumn (integration), or winter (completion)? Each phase has different needs.

\item **Stop fighting your season.** If you're in autumn, don't try to force summer's energy. If you're in spring, don't expect autumn's wisdom. Honor where you actually are—not where you think you should be.

\item **Notice the cycles within cycles.** Every day has seasons (morning/spring, afternoon/summer, evening/autumn, night/winter). Every year. Every project. Practice recognizing the rhythm at all scales.

\item **Receive each season's gifts.** Spring offers new beginnings. Summer offers expansion and creation. Autumn offers integration and release. Winter offers rest and preparation for rebirth. What is your current season offering you?

\item **Remember: winter isn't the end.** After winter comes spring. After death comes birth. After completion comes new beginning. The cycle continues. Rest in that continuity instead of clinging to any single phase.
\end{enumerate}

The cycle isn't cruel.

It's compassionate.

Because if summer lasted forever, you'd never rest.

If winter lasted forever, nothing would grow.

The rhythm—birth, growth, maturity, decline, death, rebirth—allows for both expansion and integration.

Both doing and being.

Both living and releasing.

All of it necessary.

All of it perfect.

## The Way Forward: The Next Spring

Sarah is ninety-two when she feels it clearly:

The transition.

Winter moving toward its end.

The body is ready to stop. Tired. Worn. Complete.

She's not afraid.

Because she's lived the full cycle.

Spring: learning to be.

Summer: creating and building.

Autumn: releasing and simplifying.

Winter: resting and preparing.

And after winter?

She doesn't know for certain.

But everything she's observed—in nature, in the cosmos, in the teachings—suggests:

Spring returns.

Not the same spring. Not the same body.

But consciousness continues.

The soul takes another form.

The cycle begins again.

Emma visits, now seventy herself, in her own winter.

"Are you scared?" Emma asks, holding her mother's hand.

Sarah shakes her head.

"I've lived a full cycle. Birth to death. I've seen how the rhythm works."

"And after?"

Sarah smiles.

"After winter comes spring."

"You really believe that?"

"I've watched it happen at every scale. Why would consciousness be the exception?"

Emma is quiet for a while.

Then: "What do you think your next spring will be like?"

"I don't know. But I trust the cycle."

Sarah closes her eyes.

She can feel it—the way autumn trees feel the coming winter, the way seeds feel the coming spring.

The transition.

The completion.

The continuation.

*At the beginning of the day, all living entities become manifest from the unmanifest state, and thereafter, when the night falls, they are merged into the unmanifest again.*

Day. Night. Day. Night.

The rhythm eternal.

Sarah rests in it.

Completely.

## Reflection

- Which season are you in right now? In your life? In your career? In your relationships? Are you in spring's beginning, summer's expansion, autumn's integration, or winter's completion? Can you honor where you actually are instead of where you think you should be?
- What are you fighting that wants to change? Are you clinging to summer when autumn is calling? Forcing spring when winter needs to finish? What would it mean to stop resisting and flow with your actual season?
- Can you see the cycles within cycles? Notice how every day has seasons (morning energy, afternoon peak, evening wind-down, night rest). Every year. Every project. Every relationship. What if the cycle isn't enemy but teacher—showing you the perfect rhythm of growth and release?
