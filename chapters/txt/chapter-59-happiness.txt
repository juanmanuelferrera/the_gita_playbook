# Chapter 59: Happiness

## The Chase

Kevin's been chasing happiness for forty-three years.

First, it was the job.

*When I make six figures, I'll be happy.*

He made six figures.

Wasn't happy.

So then it was the house.

*When I have the house I've always wanted...*

Got the house.

Still not happy.

The car. The vacation. The promotion. The second house.

Each time, the same pattern:

Desire. Pursuit. Achievement.

Brief satisfaction.

Then... emptiness.

And the search begins again.

*Maybe the next thing will do it.*

Sitting in his home office—the one he spent fifty thousand dollars remodeling—Kevin feels the familiar hollowness.

*When will I finally be happy?*

## The Discovery

Kevin's daughter visits for the weekend.

She's twenty-five. Just graduated. Broke.

Living in a tiny studio. Working an entry-level job. Driving a fifteen-year-old car.

And she's... happy.

Genuinely happy.

"How?" Kevin asks over breakfast.

"How what?"

"How are you so content? You have nothing."

She laughs.

"I have enough. And I'm not waiting for more to enjoy what's here."

Kevin feels something crack open.

Because he has everything.

And he's miserable.

"When did you figure that out?" he asks quietly.

"Figure what out?"

"That happiness isn't something you achieve. It's something you... are?"

She considers.

"I don't know if I 'figured it out.' But yeah—I stopped thinking happiness was waiting for me in the future. It's either here now or it's not. And if it's not, getting more stuff won't fix it."

Kevin sits with that.

Forty-three years of chasing.

And his twenty-five-year-old daughter already knows what he's still learning:

Happiness isn't at the end of achievement.

It's underneath achievement.

Available now.

If you stop running long enough to notice.

## The Gītā Speaks: Happiness Isn't Conditional

Kṛṣṇa tells Arjuna something radical about happiness:

> ``That which in the beginning may be just like poison but at the end is just like nectar and which awakens one to self-realization is said to be happiness in the mode of goodness.''
>
> --- Bhagavad-gītā 18.37

Read that carefully.

Real happiness—sattvic happiness—tastes like poison at first.

Why?

Because it requires giving up the chase.

It requires sitting still when every instinct says *keep searching*.

It requires being present when the mind wants to escape into fantasy about the future.

That feels like poison initially.

But it "awakens one to self-realization."

It reveals:

You don't need anything to be happy.

You already are the happiness you're seeking.

Contrast that with the happiness most people chase:

> ``That happiness which is derived from contact of the senses with their objects and which appears like nectar at first but poison at the end is said to be of the nature of passion.''
>
> --- Bhagavad-gītā 18.38

Sense pleasure—getting what you want—tastes like nectar at first.

The new car. The promotion. The relationship. The vacation.

Sweet. Satisfying. Delicious.

But it's poison at the end.

Because it never lasts.

The pleasure fades. The craving returns. Stronger.

And you're back on the treadmill.

Chasing the next hit of temporary satisfaction.

## Living the Teaching: Stop Running

Kevin starts an experiment.

For one month, he won't pursue anything new.

No new projects. No new purchases. No new goals.

Just... be.

With what's already here.

The first week is excruciating.

Every day, his mind generates new desires:

*Maybe I should renovate the kitchen.*

*I could use a new watch.*

*What if I started that side business I've been thinking about?*

Each time, he notices the thought.

And doesn't act on it.

Just sits with the discomfort of not chasing.

Week two, something shifts.

He starts noticing things.

The way morning light hits the kitchen counter.

The taste of coffee—really tasting it—instead of gulping while checking email.

The presence of his wife across the breakfast table.

Not perfect. Not dramatic.

Just... here.

By week four, Kevin realizes:

He's been happy several times this month.

Not because anything changed externally.

But because he stopped running long enough to notice the happiness that was already present.

It's not the blazing joy he imagined.

It's quieter.

More stable.

Less dependent on circumstances.

*This is what my daughter was talking about.*

### Practice Box

**The Practice of Present Happiness**

\begin{enumerate}
\item **Stop the chase—just for today.** Don't pursue anything new. No new goals. No new purchases. No new projects. Just be with what's already here. Notice the discomfort. That's the addiction to becoming revealing itself.

\item **Name what's already good.** Right now, what's okay? What's working? What do you have that's enough? Not gratitude as spiritual bypassing—but honest acknowledgment of what's actually sufficient in this moment.

\item **Notice when you defer happiness.** Pay attention to thoughts like "I'll be happy when..." That's the mind postponing contentment. Happiness deferred is happiness denied. Ask: Can I be content now—not when conditions change, but right now, as things are?

\item **Feel the gap between craving and satisfaction.** When desire arises, don't immediately act on it. Sit with the wanting. Notice: the craving promises happiness, but does fulfilling it actually deliver? Or does it just create the next craving?

\item **Rest in being, not becoming.** Who you are right now—imperfect, incomplete, still growing—is enough. You don't need to become someone else to be happy. The happiness is in accepting what is, not in achieving what isn't.
\end{enumerate}

This isn't resignation.

It's not settling.

It's recognizing:

Happiness based on getting what you want is fragile.

It depends on circumstances aligning perfectly.

And they never do.

Not for long.

But happiness that comes from being present—from accepting what is—that's unshakeable.

Because it doesn't need anything to change.

It's already here.

## The Way Forward: The Paradox

Six months later, Kevin's life looks almost the same.

Same job. Same house. Same circumstances.

But he's different.

His daughter visits again.

"You seem lighter," she says.

Kevin smiles.

"I stopped running."

"Running from what?"

"From now. I was always living in 'when.' When I get this. When I achieve that. When circumstances finally align."

"And now?"

"Now I'm just... here."

She nods, understanding.

"Are you happy?"

Kevin considers the question.

"More often than before. Not because anything changed—but because I'm not waiting for it to."

That night, sitting in the home office he once thought would complete him, Kevin feels it:

Contentment.

Not because he has everything.

But because he's stopped believing he needs everything to be okay.

The Gītā was right:

Real happiness tastes like poison at first.

Because it requires giving up the chase.

Sitting still when you want to run.

Being present when you want to escape.

But once you taste it—really taste it—you realize:

This is what you were looking for all along.

Not in the future.

Not in achievement.

Here.

Now.

In the simple miracle of being alive and aware.

That's happiness.

Not conditional on getting.

But discovered in accepting.

## Reflection

- What are you chasing that you believe will finally make you happy? Write the list. Then ask honestly: Have previous achievements delivered lasting happiness? Or just brief satisfaction followed by the next craving? What if the chase itself is the problem?
- Can you be happy now—before circumstances change? Not "I should be grateful" but actually content. What would it feel like to stop waiting for the future to deliver what's already available in the present?
- When did you last feel genuinely content? What conditions were present? Were they external (you got what you wanted) or internal (you accepted what was)? Which kind of happiness lasts?
