# Chapter 10: Feeling Shameful

## What They Don't Know

There's a version of Carmen that everyone sees.

Confident. Competent. Put-together. The one who smiles at the morning team meeting, presents her work clearly, asks smart questions, stays late when needed. The one people describe as "having it all figured out."

And then there's the version she sees in the mirror.

The one who knows what she did three years ago. The one who remembers the lie she told to get the promotion. The affair with her colleague that nearly destroyed two marriages. The friend she betrayed when it served her career. The small cruelties and large cowardices that no one else witnessed but that she carries like stones in her chest.

That version—the real one, she thinks—is contaminated. Unforgivable. Fundamentally wrong.

Shame isn't guilt.

Guilt says, /I did something bad./ Shame says, /I am bad./

Guilt has a specific target—an action, a mistake, a choice. Shame is diffuse, total, existential. It's not about what you did. It's about what you /are/. And what you are, shame insists, is broken beyond repair.

Carmen sits in the bathroom at work, door locked, scrolling through congratulatory messages about her latest project success. Each "congrats!" feels like mockery. /If they knew,/ she thinks. /If they really knew who I am.../

Shame tells you you're an impostor. Not in your skills—you might actually be competent. But in your humanity. You don't deserve to be treated like everyone else. You don't deserve kindness, belonging, love.

You deserve to be exposed. Rejected. Cast out.

And so you hide. Perform. Manage the image. Make sure no one sees the truth.

Because if they did, shame whispers, they'd leave. And they'd be right to.

## The Weight You're Carrying

Most of us carry shame about something.

Maybe it's something you did. An affair. A betrayal. A lie. Something you're not proud of, something that violated your own values, something that—if known—would change how people see you.

Maybe it's something that was done to you. Abuse. Violation. Trauma. And somehow, illogically, you feel ashamed of it. As if being harmed made you dirty, less than, unworthy.

Maybe it's something you /are/. Your desires. Your identity. Your body. Your past. Something about your essential self that doesn't match what you were taught was acceptable, lovable, good.

Whatever the source, shame operates the same way:

It hides. Shame can't survive in light, so it keeps you secret. You become expert at managing information, curating your image, showing only the acceptable parts.

It isolates. If the real you is unacceptable, then connection becomes impossible. You can have relationships with the persona you've created, but not with your actual self. So you're surrounded by people and utterly alone.

It distorts. Shame magnifies your flaws and minimizes your worth. A single mistake becomes total contamination. A temporary failure becomes permanent identity. You forget the good and see only the bad—because that's what shame needs you to see.

And it lies.

Shame tells you that you're uniquely broken. That everyone else is fine and you're the exception. That if people knew the truth, they'd reject you—because the truth is unacceptable.

But here's what the Bhagavad-gītā reveals:

Your actions don't define your essence. Your history doesn't determine your worth. Your mistakes—even serious ones—don't make you fundamentally different from every other human being.

Because beneath all the actions, all the history, all the mistakes—there's something uncontaminated.

Your eternal self.

## The Gītā Speaks: The Unstained Self

Arjuna comes to Kṛṣṇa carrying shame.

Not just about what he's about to do (or not do) on the battlefield, but about what he's already done. He's a warrior. He's killed. He's made choices that cost lives. He stands in a tradition built on violence, and now, facing the consequences of that tradition, he feels the weight of it.

"I am confused about my duty and have lost all composure because of miserly weakness," he says (BG 2.7).

Translation: I'm ashamed. I don't know who I am anymore. I can't hold myself together.

But Kṛṣṇa doesn't shame him further. Doesn't say, "You should be ashamed." Doesn't confirm the contamination.

Instead, he points to what shame can't touch:

> ``As a person puts on new garments, giving up old ones, the soul similarly accepts new material bodies, giving up the old and useless ones.''
>
> --- Bhagavad-gītā 2.22

You are not your body. You are not even your current mind with its history and habits and patterns.

You are the /soul/—the consciousness that moves through bodies, through experiences, through lifetimes. Like changing clothes.

The mistakes you made? Those happened within a particular body, a particular mind, a particular set of circumstances. They're real. They had consequences. But they didn't stain your essential nature.

Kṛṣṇa continues:

> ``The soul can never be cut to pieces by any weapon, nor burned by fire, nor moistened by water, nor withered by the wind... He is everlasting, present everywhere, unchangeable, immovable and eternally the same.''
>
> --- Bhagavad-gītā 2.23-24

Your essential self cannot be contaminated.

Not by what you did. Not by what was done to you. Not by your desires or your identity or your past.

The soul is eternally pure—not because it's morally perfect, but because it's /ontologically separate/ from the actions, the experiences, the temporary manifestations that shame fixates on.

Does this mean your actions don't matter? That you shouldn't feel remorse? That you have no responsibility?

No.

It means you can take full responsibility for your actions /without/ identifying with them as your essence. You can acknowledge harm done, make amends, change behavior—all without believing that the harm makes you fundamentally unworthy of existence.

Shame says: I am the mistake.

The Gītā says: I am the eternal self who made a mistake within temporary circumstances.

One leads to hiding and despair.

The other leads to accountability and freedom.

## Living the Teaching: Releasing the Weight

Carmen finally tells someone.

Not everyone. Not publicly. But her therapist. And then, months later, her sister.

She tells them what she did. The lie. The affair. The betrayal. All of it. The things that shame has been using to convince her she's irredeemable.

And something happens that shame didn't predict:

They don't leave.

Her therapist listens without judgment. Asks what led to those choices. Helps her see the pain she was in, the patterns she was repeating, the human frailty that connects her to everyone else who's ever acted from fear or hurt or confusion.

Her sister cries with her. Says, "You're still my sister. You're still the same person I've loved my whole life."

And Carmen realizes: shame lied.

The truth didn't destroy her. It freed her.

Because now she doesn't have to hide. Doesn't have to perform. Doesn't have to make sure no one sees the real her.

The real her—mistakes and all—is acceptable. Not perfect. Not blameless. But human. And worthy of love.

She starts a practice her therapist suggests. Every morning, before the shame can start its litany of accusations, she says one sentence:

/I am not my mistakes. I am the eternal self learning through temporary experiences./

At first it feels like a lie. Like spiritual bypassing. Like excusing what she did.

But slowly, she understands the distinction.

Acknowledging her eternal nature doesn't erase her responsibility. It gives her a foundation /from which to be responsible/. She can face what she did. Make amends where possible. Change her patterns. Learn. Grow.

Because she's not defending a contaminated self. She's a fundamentally whole person who acted harmfully—and who can now act differently.

Shame kept her frozen. This truth sets her in motion.

### Practice Box

**The Practice of Separating Self from Shame**

1. **Name what you're ashamed of.** Write it down. Be specific. What did you do? What happened to you? What are you hiding? Shame loses power when it's spoken.

2. **Separate action from essence.** Say it explicitly: ``I did X'' (fact about action) vs. ``I am X'' (false conclusion about self). The action is real. The conclusion is shame's lie.

3. **Remember the Gītā's teaching.** Your soul is ``unchangeable, everlasting, eternally the same.'' Your mistakes don't contaminate it. They're temporary. You're eternal.

4. **Take responsibility without identity.** Make amends if possible. Change behavior. Learn. But do it from the foundation of your inherent worth, not from the belief that you're fundamentally broken.

5. **Share with someone safe.** Not to perform confession, but to discover that being known doesn't mean being rejected. Shame thrives in hiding. Vulnerability defeats it.

You're not damaged goods. You're the eternal self having a human experience—which includes mistakes, learning, and growth.

## The Way Forward: Living Unashamed

A year later, Carmen is at a team lunch when a colleague makes a joke about "people who lie to get ahead."

The old Carmen would have felt the comment like a knife. Would have gone silent. Would have spent the rest of the day spiraling in shame, convinced everyone somehow knew, that the joke was aimed at her.

This Carmen feels something different.

A twinge. Recognition that yes, she did that. It wasn't okay. She's made amends where she could and changed her behavior since.

But she doesn't collapse into identity with it.

She laughs with the group. Not because she's denying what she did. But because she's not /hiding/ anymore. The truth is no longer a weapon that shame holds over her.

Later, she mentors a young colleague who's struggling with a mistake she made. The colleague is drowning in self-recrimination, convinced she's ruined her career, that she doesn't belong.

Carmen tells her something true:

"You made a mistake. That's real. Fix it if you can, learn from it, do better. But don't confuse the action with who you are. You're not the mistake. You're the person learning from it."

The colleague looks surprised. "How do you know?"

Carmen smiles. "Because I've been where you are. And I'm still here. Still learning. Still worthy."

That night, looking in the mirror—the same mirror where shame used to whisper contamination—Carmen sees something different.

Not perfection. Not someone who's never made mistakes. Not even someone who's "overcome" shame entirely.

But someone who remembers what she actually is beneath all the mistakes, all the history, all the temporary manifestations:

The eternal self. Unchangeable. Unstained. Free.

And that changes everything.

## Reflection

- What are you ashamed of? What are you hiding because you fear it makes you fundamentally unacceptable?
- Can you separate what you /did/ (or what happened to you) from who you /are/?
- What would change if you truly believed your essential self cannot be contaminated?
