# Chapter 37: Expectations

## The Perfect Plan

Trevor has it all mapped out.

The proposal will happen at sunset. The restaurant on the pier—her favorite place. He's arranged for a violinist. The ring is perfect. She's going to cry. She's going to say yes.

He's been planning this for three months.

And when the moment comes, she does cry.

But she doesn't say yes.

She says, "I need time."

Trevor stands there, ring box open, violinist still playing, sunset painting the sky exactly as planned.

Everything was perfect.

Except the outcome.

Two weeks later, they're having coffee. She's apologetic. He's numb.

"I just… I didn't expect to feel so panicked," she says. "I love you. But marriage? I'm not ready. I don't know if I'll ever be ready."

Trevor hears the words. But what he's thinking is: *This wasn't how it was supposed to go.*

He did everything right. He planned. He waited. He chose the perfect moment.

And it still didn't work.

## When Reality Refuses the Script

We all have expectations.

About how things should go. About what we deserve. About what happens when we do everything right.

And when reality doesn't match the script, we feel betrayed.

Trevor's expectation was reasonable. People who love each other get married. He proposed beautifully. She should have said yes.

But "should" doesn't create reality.

Expectations promise control. They say, "If you do X, Y will follow. If you plan well enough, work hard enough, love well enough, life will cooperate."

But life doesn't cooperate.

People change their minds. Circumstances shift. What you thought was certain becomes uncertain. What you earned doesn't arrive. What you deserved gets denied.

And when the gap between expectation and reality opens up, we fall into it.

Trevor can't eat. Can't sleep. Every plan he made—the wedding venue he'd researched, the honeymoon he'd imagined, the life they'd talked about—all of it evaporates.

What's left is just the ache of "supposed to."

This is what expectations do when we cling to them. They turn every deviation into a disaster. Every surprise into a betrayal. Every uncertain outcome into evidence that the universe is broken.

Or that we are.

## The Gītā Speaks: Action Without Attachment to Results

Kṛṣṇa's central teaching to Arjuna is about exactly this: the gap between action and outcome.

> ``You have a right to perform your prescribed duties, but you are not entitled to the fruits of your actions. Never consider yourself to be the cause of the results of your activities, nor be attached to inaction.''
>
> --- Bhagavad-gītā 2.47

Read that again.

**You have a right to perform your duties.** Trevor had every right to propose. To plan. To love her well and ask for a future together.

**But you're not entitled to the fruits.** He wasn't entitled to a yes. To certainty. To his plan becoming reality.

**Don't be attached to inaction.** And he also can't just stop acting—stop risking, stop trying, stop living—because outcomes are uncertain.

This is the razor's edge the Gītā asks us to walk: act fully, without controlling results.

Later, Kṛṣṇa clarifies:

> ``One who is not disturbed in mind even amidst the threefold miseries or elated when there is happiness, and who is free from attachment, fear and anger, is called a sage of steady mind.''
>
> --- Bhagavad-gītā 2.56

The sage isn't someone who never faces disappointment. It's someone who isn't *disturbed* by it. Doesn't let the gap between expectation and reality define their peace.

Trevor's expectation was about control. If I do this right, reality will comply.

But the Gītā's teaching is about freedom. Do what's yours to do. Let reality be what it is.

## Living the Teaching: Letting Go of Outcomes

Trevor sits with the wreckage of his expectations for weeks.

Then, slowly, he starts asking different questions.

Not "Why didn't she say yes?" but "What's actually true right now?"

### Practice Box

**The Practice of Releasing Expectations**

**1. Name the expectation.** Get honest. What did you expect? What were you attached to? Write it down clearly: "I expected she would say yes."

**2. Acknowledge the disappointment.** Don't bypass it. The gap hurts. Let yourself feel it without making it mean something catastrophic about you or life.

**3. Separate action from outcome.** Ask: "Did I act with integrity? Did I do what was mine to do?" If yes, release the outcome. It's not yours to control.

**4. Accept what is.** Reality is what it is, not what you expected. Can you meet it without resentment? Without making it wrong?

**5. Act again without guarantees.** Life continues. The next action won't come with certainty either. Can you move forward anyway?

Trevor realizes: He acted with love. He was honest. He offered himself fully.

Her response? That was hers. Not his to control. Not his to predict.

He calls her. Not to convince. Just to talk.

"I'm hurt," he says. "But I understand you need time. And I don't want to lose you while you figure it out."

She's quiet. Then: "What does that look like?"

"I don't know," Trevor admits. "But I'd rather find out than walk away because you didn't follow my script."

It's terrifying. No guarantees. No timeline. No certainty.

But it's also real.

And real, he's learning, is better than perfect.

## The Way Forward: Living Without Guarantees

Six months later, Trevor and his girlfriend are still together.

They're not engaged. Maybe they will be someday. Maybe they won't.

Trevor has stopped trying to control the future.

Not because he doesn't care. Because he's learned that attachment to outcomes is just fear wearing a planning hat.

One evening, she asks, "Do you still want to marry me?"

Trevor thinks about it. "I want to be with you. However that looks. If that's marriage someday, great. If it's something else, I'm open."

She smiles. "That's growth."

He laughs. "That's survival."

But it's also freedom.

Because when you release expectations, you're not giving up on life. You're giving up on the exhausting attempt to force reality to match your blueprint.

You act. Fully. Honestly. With integrity.

And then you let go.

Maybe it works out the way you hoped. Maybe it doesn't. Maybe it works out better than you imagined. Maybe it works out in ways you can't yet see.

But either way, your peace isn't held hostage to outcomes you don't control.

That's not resignation. It's liberation.

## Reflection

- What expectation are you clinging to that's causing you suffering? What outcome are you demanding from life, from others, from yourself?
- Can you separate your actions (which are yours) from the results (which aren't)? Did you act with integrity? If yes, can you release the outcome?
- What would change if you accepted reality as it is, rather than insisting it match your expectations? What freedom might be waiting on the other side of your attachment?
