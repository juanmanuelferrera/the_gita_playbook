Chapter 37: Expectations

Opening Story

Trevor has it all mapped out.

The proposal will happen at sunset. The restaurant on the pier--her favorite place. He's arranged for a violinist. The ring is perfect. She's going to cry. She's going to say yes.

He's been planning this for three months.

And when the moment comes, she does cry.

But she doesn't say yes.

She says, "I need time."

Trevor stands there, ring box open, violinist still playing, sunset painting the sky exactly as planned.

Everything was perfect.

Except the outcome.

Two weeks later, they're having coffee. She's apologetic. He's numb.

"I just... I didn't expect to feel so panicked," she says. "I love you. But marriage? I'm not ready. I don't know if I'll ever be ready."

Trevor hears the words. But what he's thinking is: This wasn't how it was supposed to go.

He did everything right. He planned. He waited. He chose the perfect moment.

And it still didn't work.

Reflective Bridge

We all have expectations. About how things should go. About what we deserve. About what happens when we do everything right.

And when reality doesn't match the script, we feel betrayed.

Trevor's expectation was reasonable. People who love each other get married. He proposed beautifully. She should have said yes.

But "should" doesn't create reality.

Expectations promise control. They say, "If you do X, Y will follow. If you plan well enough, work hard enough, love well enough, life will cooperate."

But life doesn't cooperate. People change their minds. Circumstances shift. What you thought was certain becomes uncertain.

And when the gap between expectation and reality opens up, we fall into it.

Trevor can't eat. Can't sleep. Every plan he made--the wedding venue he'd researched, the honeymoon he'd imagined, the life they'd talked about--all of it evaporates. What's left is just the ache of "supposed to."

This is what expectations do when we cling to them. They turn every deviation into a disaster. Every surprise into a betrayal. Every uncertain outcome into evidence that the universe is broken.

Or worse--that we are.

And when the mind spirals, tangled in anxieties of its own making, the result is predictable. We grip tighter. We demand more. We bind ourselves to outcomes that were never ours to control.

The Gita Speaks: Action Without Entitlement

Krishna's central teaching to Arjuna cuts to the heart of this struggle--the gap between action and outcome.

  "You have a right to perform your prescribed duties, but you are not entitled to the fruits of your actions. Never consider yourself to be the cause of the results of your activities, nor be attached to inaction."

  -- Bhagavad-gita 2.47

Read that again.

You have a right to perform your duties. Trevor had every right to propose. To plan. To love her well and ask for a future together.

But you're not entitled to the fruits. He wasn't entitled to a yes. To certainty. To his plan becoming reality.

Don't be attached to inaction. And he also can't just stop acting--stop risking, stop trying, stop living--because outcomes are uncertain.

This is the razor's edge the Gita asks us to walk: act fully, without controlling results.

But why does the mind resist this? Because the ego believes it is the author of every result. Krishna explains:

  "Therefore, fight, O Arjuna, surrendering to Me all your works, with full knowledge of Me, without desire for gain, without sense of possession and free from lethargy."

  -- Bhagavad-gita 3.30

Surrender all your works. Not surrender your effort--surrender your claim on the results. Trevor acted with love. That love was real. But the moment he insisted the outcome match his blueprint, he stopped offering love and started demanding payment.

Why must we continue to act, even without guarantees? Krishna reveals the importance of steady action through his own example:

  "For if I were to fail to carefully perform the prescribed duties, O Partha, no doubt all men would follow my path."

  -- Bhagavad-gita 3.23

Even the Supreme acts without attachment to results. The divine continues to perform duties not for personal gain, but to set an example. Trevor must continue to act--to love, to risk, to show up--not because he's entitled to specific outcomes, but because that's what it means to live with integrity.

Krishna also reveals what life looks like when someone has truly internalized this:

  "He is satisfied with gains that come by themselves, he has overcome duality, he is free from all envy, and he is stable in both success and failure. Therefore, he never gets entangled even though he executes actions."

  -- Bhagavad-gita 4.22

Satisfied with gains that come by themselves. Stable in both success and failure. Never entangled even while acting.

This isn't passivity. It's freedom. The person described here doesn't stop working, doesn't stop loving, doesn't stop proposing at sunset. They simply stop demanding that reality obey their script.

And what happens to those who cannot release their grip?

  "Thus perplexed by various anxieties and bound by a web of illusions, they become too attached to sense enjoyment and fall into hell."

  -- Bhagavad-gita 16.16

A web of illusions. That's what Trevor wove for himself--an elaborate future that existed only in his mind. When reality refused to conform, the web didn't catch him. It trapped him.

The anxiety wasn't caused by her answer. It was caused by his attachment to a different answer.

Living the Teaching

Trevor sits with the wreckage of his expectations for weeks.

Then, slowly, he starts asking different questions.

Not "Why didn't she say yes?" but "What's actually true right now?"

Practice Box

1. Name the expectation. Get honest. What did you expect? What were you attached to? Write it down clearly: "I expected she would say yes."

2. Separate action from outcome. Ask: "Did I act with integrity? Did I do what was mine to do?" If yes, the action was complete. The outcome was never yours to control.

3. Accept what is. Reality is what it is, not what you expected. Can you meet it without resentment? Without making it wrong?

4. Act again without guarantees. Life continues. The next action won't come with certainty either. Can you move forward anyway--surrendering the results, free from lethargy?

Trevor realizes: he acted with love. He was honest. He offered himself fully.

Her response? That was hers. Not his to control. Not his to predict.

He calls her. Not to convince. Just to talk.

"I'm hurt," he says. "But I understand you need time. And I don't want to lose you while you figure it out."

She's quiet. Then: "What does that look like?"

"I don't know," Trevor admits. "But I'd rather find out than walk away because you didn't follow my script."

It's terrifying. No guarantees. No timeline. No certainty.

But it's also real.

And real, he's learning, is better than perfect.

The Way Forward

Six months later, Trevor and his girlfriend are still together.

They're not engaged. Maybe they will be someday. Maybe they won't.

Trevor has stopped trying to control the future. Not because he doesn't care. Because he's learned that attachment to outcomes is just fear wearing a planning hat.

One evening, she asks, "Do you still want to marry me?"

Trevor thinks about it. "I want to be with you. However that looks. If that's marriage someday, great. If it's something else, I'm open."

She smiles. "That's growth."

He laughs. "That's survival."

But it's also freedom. Because when you release expectations, you're not giving up on life. You're giving up on the exhausting attempt to force reality to match your blueprint.

You act. Fully. Honestly. With integrity.

And then you let go.

Satisfied with gains that come by themselves. Stable in both success and failure. Never entangled--even while fully engaged.

That's not resignation. It's liberation.

Reflection

- What expectation are you clinging to that's causing you suffering? What outcome are you demanding from life, from others, from yourself?
- Can you separate your actions--which are yours--from the results--which aren't? Did you act with integrity? If yes, can you release the outcome?
- What web of illusions have you woven from your anxieties? What freedom might be waiting on the other side of your attachment?
