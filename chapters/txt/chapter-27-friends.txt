Chapter 27: Friends

The Unanswered Text

Omar stares at his phone. The text from Jake sits there, three days old now:

Hey man, been a while. Want to grab a beer this weekend?

Omar keeps meaning to reply. Keeps not doing it.

It has been a while. Six months? Maybe longer. They used to talk every week -- best friends since college, through career changes, relationships, everything.

But somewhere in the past year, the texts got less frequent. The calls stopped. And now Jake reaching out feels... heavy.

Not because Omar doesn't care. He does. But responding means explaining where he's been, why he's been distant. It means vulnerability Omar isn't sure he has energy for.

So the text sits there, accusingly unanswered.

His wife, Layla, notices him staring at the phone. "Is that Jake again?"

"Yeah."

"You should answer him."

"I know."

"So why don't you?"

Good question. Why doesn't he?

Because Jake knew him before the promotion, before the house, before the carefully constructed version of Omar that everyone sees now. Jake knew Omar when he was broke, confused, making terrible decisions.

And seeing Jake means remembering that version of himself. Means admitting he's not as together as he pretends to be.

Easier to just... drift.

I'll text him back tomorrow, Omar thinks. When I have more energy.

But tomorrow never comes.


When Friendship Fades

Friendships die quietly.

Not with fights or betrayals -- though those happen. But more often, they fade through benign neglect. Through the slow accumulation of unanswered texts and canceled plans and "we should get together sometime" that never becomes a date.

We tell ourselves we're busy. Life got complicated. Priorities shifted.

All true. But beneath the excuses, there's often something else:

Fear.

Fear that we've changed too much. Fear that they'll judge how we've changed. Fear that the friendship that once nourished us now demands energy we don't have to give.

Omar loves Jake. But Jake represents a mirror Omar doesn't want to look into.

Jake knew Omar before he had to prove anything to anyone. Before the performance of success. And if Omar lets him back in, he might have to drop the mask.

That's terrifying.

So Omar avoids. Not cruelly -- just passively. The friendship doesn't end. It just... fades.

And with it, something valuable is lost.

Because real friendship -- the kind that lasts -- isn't about convenience. It's about witnessing. About being known, fully, and loved anyway.

That's rare. Precious. And hard.


The Gita Speaks: The Most Dear Friend

The Gita doesn't merely mention friendship in passing. It places friendship at the center of its revelation.

Krishna chooses to share the deepest knowledge of existence not with a priest, not with a scholar, but with a friend:

   "That very ancient science of the relationship with the Supreme is today told by Me to you because you are My devotee as well as My friend; therefore you can understand the transcendental mystery of this science."

   -- Bhagavad-gita 4.3

Read that carefully. Krishna says Arjuna can receive this knowledge because he is a friend. Not despite it. Friendship -- real friendship -- is a qualification for receiving truth.

Why? Because friendship requires trust. Openness. The willingness to hear hard things without running away.

Omar is running. Not from Jake -- from the truth Jake represents. The truth that Omar is still uncertain, still struggling, still human beneath the polished exterior.

A real friend holds space for that truth. A real friend doesn't need you to perform.

And then Krishna declares what he actually is to all beings:

   "I am the goal, the sustainer, the master, the witness, the abode, the refuge and the most dear friend."

   -- Bhagavad-gita 9.18

The most dear friend. God himself claims this title. Not king. Not judge. Not distant ruler. Friend.

If the Supreme considers friendship sacred enough to claim as his identity, what does that say about how we should treat ours?

And what does a real friend look like? The Gita offers a portrait:

   "A person is said to be still further advanced when he regards all -- the honest well-wisher, friends and enemies, the envious, the pious, the sinner and those who are indifferent and impartial -- with an equal mind."

   -- Bhagavad-gita 6.9

Equal vision. Not judging Jake for being the same guy he always was. Not judging himself for still being uncertain. Seeing clearly, without the hierarchy of "I've moved on" or "he wouldn't understand."

That equality is the foundation of real friendship.


Living the Teaching

So what does Omar do?

Keep avoiding until the friendship dies completely? Or take the risk of actually showing up?

Practice Box

The Honest Friendship Practice

1. Acknowledge the avoidance.
Don't pretend you're just busy. Name the real reason you're pulling away. Fear of judgment? Fear of vulnerability? Fear of being truly seen?

2. Remember what real friendship requires.
Not perfection. Not constant contact. Just honesty. Can you show up as you actually are, right now, without performing?

3. Make contact -- honestly.
Don't wait until you feel "ready." You'll never feel ready. Reach out. Tell the truth: "I've been avoiding you, and I'm sorry. Here's why."


The Way Forward

Omar picks up his phone.

Not to text. To call.

Jake answers on the second ring. "Omar! Finally! I was starting to think you'd blocked me."

"No, man. I just... I've been avoiding you."

Silence. Then: "Okay. Why?"

Omar takes a breath. "Honestly? I don't know. I think... I think I've been feeling like I need to have my shit together before I see you. And I don't. And that's... embarrassing, I guess."

"Embarrassing? Dude, you remember sophomore year when I got dumped and didn't shower for two weeks?"

Omar laughs despite himself. "Yeah, you were disgusting."

"Exactly. So whatever you're going through, I guarantee I've been more of a mess. That's kind of our thing, right? Taking turns being disasters?"

And just like that, the weight lifts.

Not completely. There's still the work of actually reconnecting, of rebuilding the rhythm they used to have.

But the door is open again.

They make plans. This weekend. Nothing fancy -- just a beer and honesty.

When Omar hangs up, Layla is smiling. "Feel better?"

"Yeah," he says. "I forgot how easy it is with him. When I stop making it hard."

"That's what real friends do. They let you just... be."

Later that week, Omar meets Jake at their old bar. The one they used to go to every Thursday in their twenties.

And for three hours, Omar doesn't perform. Doesn't curate. Doesn't hide.

He just talks. About the job stress. The fear of becoming his father. The weird emptiness that comes with finally getting everything he thought he wanted.

And Jake listens. Doesn't try to fix it. Doesn't judge. Just... witnesses.

At the end of the night, Jake says, "We should do this more often. And not wait six months."

"Agreed."

"You know what I realized?" Jake says. "I was avoiding reaching out too. Because I figured you'd moved on to cooler friends with your fancy life."

Omar laughs. "Man, I don't have cooler friends. I barely have friends at all anymore."

"Well, you've got me. Even when you're being an avoidant idiot."

"Same to you."

They shake hands. Hug. Promise to actually follow through this time.

And driving home, Omar feels something he hasn't felt in months:

Known.

Not because Jake fixed anything. But because he witnessed. Accepted. Remained.

That's friendship. The most dear friend. And it's worth showing up for.

Even when it's scary.


Reflection

- Which friendships are you letting fade through avoidance rather than actively choosing to end? What are you afraid will happen if you show up honestly?
- Who has remained steady in your life through both happiness and distress? Have you told them what that means to you?
- If Krishna himself claims the title "most dear friend," what does that tell you about the sacredness of the friendships you already have?
