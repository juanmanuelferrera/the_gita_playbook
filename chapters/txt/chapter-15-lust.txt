# Chapter 15: Lust

## The Obsession

Thomas can't stop thinking about her.

Not his wife—though he loves his wife, married fifteen years, two kids, good life. This is someone else. Maya. The new project manager at work. Twenty-nine. Smart. Funny. The kind of presence that makes a room feel different when she walks in.

It started innocently. Meetings. Emails. Professional. Then coffee to discuss the Mitchell account. Then lunch. Then texts that weren't quite about work but weren't quite /not/ about work either.

Nothing's happened. Nothing physical. But something's happening.

Thomas is obsessed.

He checks his phone constantly—did she text? He manufactures reasons to walk past her desk. He replays their conversations, analyzing every word for hidden meaning. He fantasizes—not just sexually (though that too), but emotionally. What if. What could be. What it would feel like to be /seen/ by her the way he imagines she sees him.

He knows it's destructive. Knows he's playing with fire. Knows where this leads if he doesn't stop.

But he can't stop. Or won't. The line between can't and won't has blurred.

Because the obsession isn't just about Maya. It's about the feeling she represents: /aliveness/. The marriage has become routine. Comfortable. Safe. And somewhere in that safety, he stopped feeling fully alive. Stopped feeling /desired/. Stopped feeling like he matters beyond being the provider, the dad, the reliable one.

Maya—or the fantasy of Maya—offers escape from that. A return to intensity. To being /wanted/. To mattering in a way that feels electric instead of merely functional.

So he feeds the obsession. Justifies it. /It's just thinking. Just feeling. Nothing's happened./

But Thomas knows the truth:

Lust has already destroyed him. Not by making him do something. But by making him want to.

## Desire That Destroys

Lust isn't just sexual desire.

It's /obsessive/ desire. The kind that consumes attention, distorts perception, overrides values. The kind that makes you willing to destroy what you have for the promise of what you want.

And it operates through a simple mechanism:

It convinces you that satisfaction is available /if you just act on the desire/. That the itch will be scratched, the hunger fed, the emptiness filled—if you just give in.

But here's what actually happens:

Acting on lust doesn't satisfy it. It intensifies it.

The affair doesn't cure the loneliness—it creates more. The conquest doesn't build self-worth—it erodes it. The forbidden pleasure doesn't bring peace—it brings chaos.

Because lust isn't actually about the object of desire. It's about the /craving/ itself. And craving can never be satisfied by getting what it wants. It can only be satisfied by ending the craving.

The Bhagavad-gītā makes this explicit. Lust doesn't say, "Get this thing and you'll be happy." Lust says, "Want this thing forever and call that living."

You become enslaved to the wanting. And the wanting becomes who you are.

Thomas isn't thinking about work anymore. Isn't present with his kids. Barely sees his wife even when they're in the same room. Because his attention is colonized—completely, relentlessly—by the obsession.

He's lost himself. Not to Maya. But to /lust/.

And lust doesn't care about consequences. Doesn't care about marriage, children, integrity, values, the life he's built. Lust only cares about its own satisfaction—which, paradoxically, it can never achieve.

This is why the Gītā calls lust the "all-devouring enemy." Because it devours everything. Your attention. Your values. Your relationships. Your peace. Your essential self.

All in service of a promise it can never keep.

## The Gītā Speaks: The All-Devouring Enemy

When Arjuna asks Kṛṣṇa what compels people to sin—what makes them act against their own values—Kṛṣṇa points to lust:

> ``It is lust only, Arjuna, which is born of contact with the material mode of passion and later transformed into wrath, and which is the all-devouring sinful enemy of this world.''
>
> --- Bhagavad-gītā 3.37

Lust. Born of passion. Transformed into wrath when thwarted. All-devouring.

Notice the progression: First there's desire. Then there's attachment to the desire. Then there's obsession. Then, when the desire is blocked, it becomes anger. And the anger justifies the destruction: /I deserve this. I need this. Anyone standing in my way is the enemy./

Kṛṣṇa continues:

> ``As fire is covered by smoke, as a mirror is covered by dust, or as the embryo is covered by the womb, the living entity is similarly covered by different degrees of this lust.''
>
> --- Bhagavad-gītā 3.38

Lust covers your true self.

Like smoke covering fire—you're still there, the eternal consciousness, the witness. But you can't see yourself clearly. Can't see what you're doing. Can't see where it leads.

All you can see is the object of desire. And the promise that having it will finally make you complete.

But that's the lie.

/You're already complete./ Not in the sense that you have everything you want. But in the sense that your essential nature—the eternal soul—is whole, independent of whether desires are satisfied or not.

Lust makes you forget this. Makes you think you're incomplete, that the desired object will complete you, that without it you're somehow less than whole.

One more verse:

> ``The senses, the mind and the intelligence are the sitting places of this lust. Through them lust covers the real knowledge of the living entity and bewilders him.''
>
> --- Bhagavad-gītā 3.40

Lust enters through the senses—you see, hear, touch something desirable.

Then it occupies the mind—you think about it constantly.

Then it captures the intelligence—you rationalize it, justify it, create arguments for why this is okay, why you deserve it, why it's not really wrong.

And through this progression, it "covers real knowledge." You forget who you are. What you value. What actually matters.

You become the lust. And from that position, destruction feels like fulfillment.

## Living the Teaching: Starving the Obsession

Thomas is sitting in his car in the work parking lot.

Maya just texted: /Drink after work?/

His finger hovers over the keyboard. The yes is already formed. He can feel it. The pull. The justification: /It's just a drink. Nothing has to happen. We're adults./

But then something interrupts the script.

Not a voice. Not a thought. Just... awareness.

/This is lust. This is the enemy Kṛṣṇa was talking about./

He feels the craving in his body. The way his attention is completely captured. The way everything else—his wife, his kids, his integrity—has faded to background noise while this one thing screams in the foreground.

And he recognizes: if he says yes, he's feeding it. Making it stronger. Giving it more control.

The lust doesn't say, "One drink and then you'll be satisfied." It says, "One drink and then you'll want more. And more. Until you've destroyed everything that matters to chase something that will never satisfy you."

He types a different response:

/Can't tonight. But thank you./

Hits send.

And then sits there, feeling the craving surge. It's furious. Demanding. /You idiot. You're missing your chance. This is what you want!/

But he doesn't move. Just watches the craving. Observes it the way he'd observe a storm—intense, temporary, not actually him.

Ten minutes pass.

The intensity fades. Not gone. But less absolute. Less like a command he has to obey.

He drives home. Walks in the door. His wife is making dinner. His kids doing homework. Ordinary. Familiar. Safe.

And he feels something unexpected:

Gratitude.

Not because he conquered lust forever. But because he didn't feed it today. Didn't strengthen it. Didn't give it more power.

He chose his actual life over the fantasy. And his actual life, he remembers now, is enough.

### Practice Box

**The Practice of Starving Lust**

1. **Name the obsession.** What (or who) are you obsessing over? Be honest. Lust thrives in secrecy. Bring it into the light.

2. **Recognize the pattern.** Lust follows a script: desire → fantasy → rationalization → action → regret → repeat. Where are you in the cycle right now?

3. **Stop feeding it.** Every text, every glance, every fantasy is food for the obsession. It doesn't satisfy lust—it strengthens it. Starve it by withdrawing attention.

4. **Redirect the energy.** The desire isn't bad. But it's misdirected. What are you actually hungry for? Connection? Aliveness? Being seen? Find healthy ways to meet those needs.

5. **Remember who you are.** You're not the craving. You're the eternal witness observing the craving. From that position, you can choose—not from compulsion, but from freedom.

Lust promises fulfillment through possession. Freedom comes through recognizing you're already complete.

## The Way Forward: Freedom From Obsession

Six months later, Maya leaves the company.

Takes a job in another city. Thomas feels... relief.

Not because he stopped being attracted to her. But because the removal of proximity makes the obsession unsustainable. You can't feed a fantasy when the person isn't there every day.

And in the space created by her absence, Thomas does something he's avoided for years:

He talks to his wife.

Not about Maya—that's his to carry, his to work through. But about the things beneath the obsession. The loneliness. The feeling of being invisible. The way they've drifted into routine and stopped really /seeing/ each other.

It's hard. Vulnerable. Uncomfortable.

But it's /real/. Not a fantasy. Not an escape. Real connection with the real person he's actually committed to.

And slowly—not dramatically, not instantly—things shift.

They start dating again. Actual dates. Conversation. Presence. They remember why they chose each other fifteen years ago. They build something new on the foundation of what already is.

The lust still visits sometimes. New objects. New fantasies. The mind does what minds do—generates desire, creates attraction, offers escape.

But Thomas has learned something:

He doesn't have to obey it.

Lust isn't him. It's a visitor. A pattern. A biological and psychological impulse that arises in consciousness but isn't consciousness itself.

He's the witness. And the witness can watch desire arise, acknowledge it, and choose whether or not to feed it.

Most days now, he chooses not to.

Not because he's morally superior. Not because he's conquered lust forever.

But because he's tasted both paths:

The path of feeding obsession, which promises satisfaction and delivers destruction.

And the path of witnessing desire, which offers nothing dramatic but makes actual life—the ordinary, imperfect, real life he's living—available again.

He chooses availability.

Not because it's easy. But because it's true.

And in that truth, he finds what lust had been promising all along:

Aliveness. Connection. Being seen.

Not through possession of the fantasy.

But through presence in what's actually here.

## Reflection

- What are you obsessing over? What desire has captured your attention so completely that everything else has faded?
- What are you actually hungry for beneath the lust? What need is the obsession trying to meet?
- What would freedom look like—not freedom /to/ act on every desire, but freedom /from/ being controlled by them?
