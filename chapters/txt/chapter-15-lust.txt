Chapter 15: Lust

The Obsession

Thomas can't stop thinking about her.

Not his wife -- though he loves his wife, married fifteen years, two kids, good life. This is someone else. Maya. The new project manager at work. Twenty-nine. Smart. Funny. The kind of presence that makes a room feel different when she walks in.

It started innocently. Meetings. Emails. Professional. Then coffee to discuss the Mitchell account. Then lunch. Then texts that weren't quite about work but weren't quite not about work either.

Nothing's happened. Nothing physical. But something's happening.

Thomas is obsessed.

He checks his phone constantly -- did she text? He manufactures reasons to walk past her desk. He replays their conversations, analyzing every word for hidden meaning. He fantasizes -- not just sexually, though that too -- but emotionally. What if. What could be. What it would feel like to be seen by her the way he imagines she sees him.

He knows it's destructive. Knows he's playing with fire. Knows where this leads if he doesn't stop.

But he can't stop. Or won't. The line between can't and won't has blurred.

Because the obsession isn't just about Maya. It's about the feeling she represents: aliveness. The marriage has become routine. Comfortable. Safe. And somewhere in that safety, he stopped feeling fully alive. Stopped feeling desired. Stopped feeling like he matters beyond being the provider, the dad, the reliable one.

Maya -- or the fantasy of Maya -- offers escape from that. A return to intensity. To being wanted. To mattering in a way that feels electric instead of merely functional.

So he feeds the obsession. Justifies it. It's just thinking. Just feeling. Nothing's happened.

But Thomas knows the truth: lust has already taken him. Not by making him do something. But by making him want to.


Reflective Bridge

Lust isn't just sexual desire. It's obsessive desire. The kind that consumes attention, distorts perception, overrides values. The kind that makes you willing to destroy what you have for the promise of what you want.

And it operates through a simple mechanism: it convinces you that satisfaction is available if you just act on the desire. That the itch will be scratched, the hunger fed, the emptiness filled -- if you just give in.

But acting on lust doesn't satisfy it. It intensifies it. The affair doesn't cure the loneliness -- it creates more. The conquest doesn't build self-worth -- it erodes it. The forbidden pleasure doesn't bring peace -- it brings chaos.

Because lust isn't actually about the object of desire. It's about the craving itself. And craving can never be satisfied by getting what it wants. It can only be satisfied by ending the craving.

Thomas isn't thinking about work anymore. Isn't present with his kids. Barely sees his wife even when they're in the same room. His attention is colonized -- completely, relentlessly -- by the obsession.

He's lost himself. Not to Maya. But to lust.


The Gita Speaks: The All-Devouring Enemy

When Arjuna asks Krishna what compels people to act against their own values -- what force makes them sin even when they know better -- Krishna's answer is immediate and unambiguous:

  "The Blessed Lord said: It is lust only, Arjuna, which is born of contact with the material modes of passion and later transformed into wrath, and which is the all-devouring, sinful enemy of this world."

  -- Bhagavad-gita 3.37

Lust. Born of passion. Transformed into wrath when thwarted. All-devouring.

Notice the progression: first desire, then attachment, then obsession. And when the desire is blocked, it becomes anger -- at your spouse for being in the way, at yourself for having values, at reality for not conforming to your fantasy. The anger justifies destruction: I deserve this. Anyone standing in my way is the enemy.

Thomas hasn't reached the anger stage yet. But he's moving toward it. Every time his wife interrupts a text exchange with Maya, he feels a flash of irritation. Every time his kids need attention during a fantasy, he resents the intrusion. Lust is already transforming into wrath.

Krishna doesn't leave Arjuna without a strategy:

  "Therefore, O Arjuna, best of the Bharatas, in the very beginning curb this great symbol of sin lust by regulating the senses, and slay this destroyer of knowledge and self-realization."

  -- Bhagavad-gita 3.41

In the very beginning. Not after the affair. Not after the marriage crumbles. Not after the damage is done. At the start. When the desire first takes root. Because lust, like fire, is easiest to extinguish when it's small. Wait, and it consumes everything.

"Regulating the senses" -- this means controlling what you feed. Every text to Maya is fuel. Every glance is kindling. Every fantasy is oxygen. The fire doesn't grow by itself. Thomas is feeding it.

But regulation alone isn't enough. Willpower exhausts itself. Krishna points to the deeper solution:

  "Thus knowing oneself to be transcendental to material senses, mind and intelligence, one should control the lower self by the higher self and thus -- by spiritual strength -- conquer this insatiable enemy known as lust."

  -- Bhagavad-gita 3.43

Knowing oneself to be transcendental. The senses crave Maya. The mind fantasizes about her. The intelligence rationalizes the pursuit. But Thomas is none of these. He is the self beyond senses, mind, and intelligence -- the witness who can observe the entire machinery of lust without being identical to it.

When he identifies with the craving, it's irresistible. When he identifies with the witness, he has space to choose.

Krishna also reveals why the wise don't pursue pleasures born of sensory contact:

  "An intelligent person does not take part in the sources of misery, which are due to contact with the material senses. O son of Kunti, such pleasures have a beginning and an end, and so the wise man does not delight in them."

  -- Bhagavad-gita 5.22

A beginning and an end. That's the nature of sense pleasure. The thrill of the forbidden has a beginning -- the first text, the first private lunch. And it has an end -- the aftermath, the guilt, the destruction. The wise person sees the whole arc, not just the peak. Thomas is staring at the peak. He needs to see the ending.

And finally, the warning that frames the entire struggle:

  "There are three gates leading to this hell -- lust, anger, and greed. Every sane man should give these up, for they lead to the degradation of the soul."

  -- Bhagavad-gita 16.21

Three gates. Lust is the first. If Thomas walks through it, anger and greed follow. The degradation isn't theoretical. It's the slow erosion of everything he actually values -- his family, his integrity, his capacity for real love -- in service of a craving that promises satisfaction and delivers ruin.


Living the Teaching

Thomas is sitting in his car in the work parking lot.

Maya just texted: Drink after work?

His finger hovers over the keyboard. The yes is already formed. He can feel it. The pull. The justification: It's just a drink. Nothing has to happen. We're adults.

But then something interrupts the script. Not a voice. Not a thought. Just... awareness.

This is lust. This is the all-devouring enemy.

He feels the craving in his body. The way his attention is completely captured. The way everything else -- his wife, his kids, his integrity -- has faded to background noise while this one thing screams in the foreground.

And he remembers: in the very beginning. Not later. Not after. Now.

He also remembers: such pleasures have a beginning and an end. He's staring at the beginning. But where does it end? He knows. Everyone knows. It ends in wreckage.

He types a different response: Can't tonight. But thank you.

Hits send.

And then sits there, feeling the craving surge. It's furious. Demanding. You idiot. You're missing your chance.

The lust transforming into wrath. Just as Krishna described.

But he doesn't move. He watches the craving. Observes it the way he'd observe a storm -- intense, temporary, not actually him. He is transcendental to the senses, the mind, the intelligence. He is the witness.

Ten minutes pass. The intensity fades. Not gone. But less absolute.

He drives home. Walks in the door. His wife is making dinner. His kids doing homework. Ordinary. Familiar. Safe.

And he feels something unexpected: gratitude. Not because he conquered lust forever. But because he didn't feed it today. Didn't strengthen it. Didn't walk through the first gate.

He chose his actual life over the fantasy. And his actual life, he remembers now, is enough.


Practice Box

1. Curb it at the beginning. Don't wait until you're deep in the obsession. The moment you recognize the pattern -- the extra attention, the manufactured encounters, the fantasy -- act. Reduce contact. Stop feeding the fire while it's still small.

2. See the whole arc. Lust shows you the peak. Force yourself to see the ending. Where does this lead in six months? A year? What's destroyed? Such pleasures have a beginning and an end.

3. Identify as the witness, not the craving. You are transcendental to the senses, mind, and intelligence. The craving is happening in you, not as you. Find the one who observes the desire. Choose from there.

4. Name the real hunger. What is the lust actually about? Connection? Aliveness? Being seen? Find the legitimate need beneath the destructive craving, and meet it through means that don't require burning your life down.


The Way Forward

Six months later, Maya leaves the company.

Takes a job in another city. Thomas feels relief. Not because he stopped being attracted to her. But because the removal of proximity starves the obsession of fuel.

And in the space created by her absence, Thomas does something he's avoided for years: he talks to his wife.

Not about Maya -- that's his to carry, his to work through. But about the things beneath the obsession. The loneliness. The feeling of being invisible. The way they've drifted into routine and stopped really seeing each other.

It's hard. Vulnerable. Uncomfortable.

But it's real. Not a fantasy. Not an escape. Real connection with the real person he's actually committed to.

And slowly -- not dramatically, not instantly -- things shift. They start dating again. Actual dates. Conversation. Presence. They remember why they chose each other fifteen years ago. They build something new on the foundation of what already is.

The lust still visits sometimes. New objects. New fantasies. The mind does what minds do -- generates desire, creates attraction, offers escape. Such pleasures will always have a beginning.

But Thomas has learned to see the end too.

He doesn't have to obey the craving. He is the witness. Transcendental to senses, mind, and intelligence. And the witness can watch desire arise, acknowledge it, and choose whether or not to feed it.

Most days now, he chooses not to. Not because he's morally superior. But because he's tasted both paths -- the path of feeding obsession, which promises satisfaction and delivers destruction, and the path of witnessing desire, which offers nothing dramatic but makes actual life available again.

He chooses availability. He chooses presence in what's actually here.

Not because it's easy. But because it's true. And in that truth, he finds what lust had been promising all along: aliveness. Connection. Being seen.

Not through possession of the fantasy. But through presence in reality.


Reflection

- What desire has captured your attention so completely that everything else has faded?
- Can you see the whole arc -- not just the peak of pleasure, but the beginning and the end?
- What would it mean to identify as the witness rather than the craving -- to conquer lust not through willpower alone, but through spiritual strength?
