Chapter 16: Work

The 9-to-5 Trap

Kenji's alarm goes off at 6:15 AM.

He doesn't hit snooze. He learned years ago that snooze just makes it worse -- delays the inevitable while making you feel guilty about delaying it.

So he gets up. Showers. Coffee. Toast. Commute. Email. Meetings. Lunch at desk. More meetings. More email. Commute home. Dinner. TV. Sleep.

Repeat.

He's been doing this for twelve years. Software engineer at a mid-sized company. Good salary. Benefits. Stable. Safe.

And he's dying inside.

Not dramatically. Not in a way anyone would notice. He still does his job. Meets deadlines. Participates in meetings. Smiles at appropriate moments.

But inside, there's a quiet desperation. A sense that he's trading his life -- his actual, finite, irreplaceable life -- for a paycheck. That he's spending the majority of his waking hours doing something that doesn't matter to him, doesn't fulfill him, doesn't connect to anything he actually values.

His friends say he's lucky. Stable job in an unstable economy. He should be grateful.

And he is grateful. Intellectually. But gratitude doesn't change the fact that every Sunday evening, he feels a heaviness settle in. The weekend is ending. Monday is coming. And with Monday comes the return to the trap.

The question he can't shake: Is this all there is? Work until retirement, then finally live?

But retirement is thirty years away. And thirty years of this feels like a life sentence.


Reflective Bridge

Most of us have a complicated relationship with work. We need it -- for money, for survival, for identity, for structure. But we resent it -- for the time it takes, the energy it drains, the life it displaces.

Modern culture gives us two equally unsatisfying narratives. The first: "Just endure it." Work is suffering. That's adulthood. Retirement is the reward. The second: "Follow your passion." Quit the soul-sucking job. Do what you love. Money will follow.

Both are incomplete. The first makes work a prison with no meaning beyond survival. The second makes work dependent on feeling passionate, which most people don't feel most of the time.

The Bhagavad-gita offers a third path. Not endurance. Not passion-chasing. But dharma -- your role, your duty, your function in the larger order.

And the radical claim the Gita makes is this: any work -- even work you didn't choose, even work that feels mundane -- can become meaningful if you understand its place in the larger whole and perform it as an offering rather than as a transaction.

Not "I work for money." Not "I work because I'm passionate." But: "I work as my contribution to the functioning of the world. This is my role right now. And I can perform it with excellence, regardless of whether it makes me happy."


The Gita Speaks: Sacrifice, Standards, and Surrender

The entire Bhagavad-gita is, at its core, a conversation about work. Arjuna doesn't want to do his job. He's a warrior. The battlefield is his workplace. But he doesn't want to fight. The work feels wrong, painful, meaningless.

He says to Krishna:

  "Now I am confused about my duty and have lost all composure because of weakness. In this condition I am asking You to tell me clearly what is best for me. Now I am Your disciple, and a soul surrendered unto You. Please instruct me."

  -- Bhagavad-gita 2.7

This is Kenji's prayer, whether he knows it or not. I don't know what to do. I've lost composure. Tell me what's right. The confusion about work isn't weakness -- it's the starting point of wisdom. Arjuna's honesty about his paralysis is what opens the door to Krishna's entire teaching.

And what does Krishna teach about work? First, that it is sacred when offered properly:

  "Work done as a sacrifice for Vishnu has to be performed; otherwise, work binds one to this material world. Therefore, O son of Kunti, perform your prescribed duties for His satisfaction, and in that way, you will always remain unattached and free from bondage."

  -- Bhagavad-gita 3.9

Work as sacrifice. Not sacrifice in the sense of suffering, but in the sense of offering -- doing the work for something beyond yourself. When Kenji codes for a paycheck, the work binds him. It becomes a transaction: hours for money, energy for survival. But when the same work is done as an offering -- this is my role, my contribution, my duty performed for a purpose larger than my comfort -- it becomes liberating.

The shift isn't in the work. It's in the consciousness behind the work.

Krishna then raises the stakes:

  "Whatever action is performed by a great man, common men follow in his footsteps. And whatever standards he sets by exemplary acts, all the world pursues."

  -- Bhagavad-gita 3.21

Your work matters beyond yourself. The way you work -- with resentment or with dedication, halfheartedly or fully -- sets a standard. Kenji's junior colleagues watch how he approaches his tasks. His children absorb his attitude toward labor. The quality of his engagement isn't private. It radiates.

Krishna makes this even more personal:

  "For if I were to fail to carefully perform the prescribed duties, O Partha, no doubt all men would follow my path."

  -- Bhagavad-gita 3.23

Even Krishna performs His duties. Not because He needs to. Not because He lacks anything. But because if He didn't, others would use that as excuse to abandon theirs. Work isn't optional for anyone -- not even God.

But there's a subtlety here. Krishna isn't commanding blind obedience to drudgery. He's addressing the attitude toward work, not demanding attachment to any particular job:

  "Let not the wise disrupt the minds of the ignorant who are attached to fruitive action. They should not be encouraged to refrain from work, but to engage in work in the spirit of devotion."

  -- Bhagavad-gita 3.26

The answer isn't to quit. It isn't to tell everyone that work is meaningless and they should all become monks. The answer is to transform the spirit of work -- from fruitive action (I work to get) to devotional action (I work to offer). The wise person doesn't abandon work. They sanctify it.


Living the Teaching

Kenji sits in his car in the parking lot before work.

He's been reading the Gita. Not all of it makes sense. But one idea has stuck with him: What if I stopped working for outcomes and did the work as sacrifice?

It sounds abstract. But he decides to try it. Just for today.

He walks in. Opens his laptop. Looks at his task list: debug the payment module, review code for the new feature, respond to client emails.

Usually, he'd approach this with resentment. More boring work. More hours traded for money. More meaninglessness.

But today, he tries something different.

He thinks: This is my role. Right now. In this company. These tasks are mine to do. Not for the paycheck. Not because I'm passionate. But because this is my prescribed duty. I'll do it well as an offering -- to the team that depends on this code, to the users who need this payment module to work, to the standard I set by how I engage.

He starts debugging. And something shifts.

He's not trying to get it done so he can leave. He's just... doing it. Paying attention. Being thorough. Not rushing. Not resenting. Just working.

Three hours pass. He looks up. The module is fixed. And he feels... different.

Not happy, exactly. Not passionate. But not dead inside either. There's a quiet satisfaction. Not from the result. But from the quality of his engagement. He was present. He did it well. He fulfilled his function.

Over the following weeks, he keeps practicing. Some days it works -- he finds the equanimity, does his duty, feels at ease. Some days it doesn't -- the resentment returns, the meaninglessness. But slowly, something changes.

He stops waiting for work to make him happy. Stops resenting it for not being his passion. Stops making his well-being dependent on outcomes.

And in that stopping, work becomes lighter. Not meaningful in the dramatic sense. But no longer a trap. Just: his role. His duty. His offering.


Practice Box

1. Reframe the work as offering, not transaction. Before starting your tasks, mentally offer them. Not "I work for money" but "I work as my contribution. This is my sacrifice." The tasks don't change. Your relationship to them does.

2. Set the standard. Others are watching -- colleagues, children, anyone in your sphere. The way you work is the standard you set. Do it with the care you'd want others to bring to their duties.

3. Engage fully, release outcomes. You don't control whether your work gets recognized, rewarded, or even noticed. You control the quality of your effort. Give that fully. Let go of the rest.

4. Work in the spirit of devotion. Not grudging compliance. Not passionate excitement. Devotion -- steady, present, purposeful engagement because this is yours to do and you choose to do it well.


The Way Forward

Two years later, Kenji is still at the same company.

Same job. Same tasks. Same commute.

But he's different.

He stopped waiting for work to fulfill him. Stopped resenting it for not being his calling. Stopped making Sunday evenings miserable by dreading Monday.

Instead, he shows up. Does his work. Does it well. And goes home. Not in a resigned way. But in a "this is mine to do right now, so I do it as my offering" way.

And something unexpected has happened: the work has become easier. Not because the tasks changed. But because he's no longer fighting them. He's not spending half his energy resenting what he has to do. He just does it.

He's also started pursuing things outside work that matter to him. Photography. Volunteering. Time with friends. Things that don't pay but that feed something work doesn't. Because he realized: work doesn't have to be everything. It doesn't have to be his passion, his identity, his source of meaning.

It's his duty. His role. His offering to the functioning of the whole.

Last week, a coworker asked him: "How do you not hate it here?"

Kenji paused. Thought about it.

"I stopped asking work to make me happy," he said. "I just do what's mine to do. And I try to do it well enough that anyone watching would know: this is how work should be done."

Whatever action is performed by a great man, common men follow. Kenji isn't claiming to be great. But he's setting a standard -- quietly, consistently, through the quality of his engagement.

And in that standard, he's found what he was looking for all along. Not passion. Not fulfillment. Not escape.

But peace. The peace that comes from doing what's yours to do -- fully, without attachment, as sacrifice -- and letting that be enough.


Reflection

- What are you asking work to give you that it can't provide?
- What would change if you approached your tasks as offerings rather than transactions -- as sacrifice rather than drudgery?
- What standard does the quality of your work set for those who watch?
