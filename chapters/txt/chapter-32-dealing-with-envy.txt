# Chapter 32: Dealing with Envy

## The Promotion That Wasn't Yours

Malik hears about Sophie's promotion from someone else.

Not from Sophie—they haven't spoken in three weeks. Not from their manager. From Karen in accounting, casually mentioning it by the coffee machine.

"Oh, you didn't hear? Sophie got the regional director position. Starting next month."

Malik forces a smile. "That's great for her."

But inside, something twists. Sharp. Acidic.

Because he applied for that position. Interviewed for it. Spent weeks preparing, networking, positioning himself.

And Sophie—who started six months after him, who he trained, who he helped navigate office politics—got it instead.

The rational part of his brain understands. Sophie is talented. Deserving. This isn't a personal attack.

But the feeling that rises in his chest isn't rational.

It's envy. Pure, corrosive envy.

And it doesn't just hurt—it makes him hate himself for feeling it.

Because good people don't envy their friends' success, right? Good people celebrate. Support. Cheer them on.

But Malik can't. Every time he sees Sophie's name on an email, every time someone congratulates her, he feels it again. That bitter, burning sensation that whispers: *It should have been you.*

And worse: *She doesn't deserve it as much as you do.*

He knows it's poison. But he can't stop drinking it.

## The Poison That Tastes Like Justice

Envy is different from jealousy.

Jealousy says: "I want what you have." It's acquisitive. Grasping.

Envy says: "You shouldn't have what you have." It's destructive. Resentful.

Jealousy wants to possess. Envy wants to diminish.

And that's why envy is so corrosive. It doesn't motivate you to improve—it motivates you to tear others down. To find their flaws. To minimize their achievements. To secretly hope they fail.

Malik starts doing it without realizing. When colleagues praise Sophie's vision, he thinks: *She got those ideas from me.* When she's celebrated for closing a deal: *I introduced her to that client.* When she's described as a natural leader: *Only because I taught her how to navigate this place.*

He's not lying—there's truth in all of it. But he's using that truth like a weapon. To protect his ego. To justify the burning feeling that won't go away.

Because envy doesn't feel like a character flaw. It feels like justice denied.

*I worked harder. I sacrificed more. I deserve it more.*

And maybe that's even true. But envy doesn't care about truth. It cares about feeding the wound.

The Gītā understands envy. Deeply. Because it destroys from within.

## The Gītā Speaks: The Self-Consuming Fire

Kṛṣṇa doesn't mince words about envy. He calls it a quality of the demoniac nature—those who are bound to their egos, unable to see beyond their own desires.

Harsh? Maybe. But accurate.

Because envy is fundamentally about ego. About the belief that your worth is measured by comparison. That someone else's gain is your loss.

And the Gītā offers this warning:

> ``Those who are envious and mischievous, who are the lowest among men, are cast by Me into the ocean of material existence, into various demoniac species of life.''
>
> --- Bhagavad-gītā 16.19

This isn't punishment. It's consequence.

Envy traps you in a cycle of comparison, resentment, and suffering. It makes you incapable of joy—yours or anyone else's. It turns every success around you into evidence of your own failure.

That's not divine retribution. That's just what envy does. It creates hell. Right here.

But why? Why do we envy?

Kṛṣṇa gives the answer:

> ``One who is not envious but who is a kind friend to all living entities, who does not think himself a proprietor, who is free from false ego... such a person is very dear to Me.''
>
> --- Bhagavad-gītā 12.13-14

Notice the connection: Envy arises from false ego. From the belief that you own your achievements. That you deserve recognition. That your worth is determined by external validation.

When you think you're the proprietor—the cause of your success—then someone else's success feels like theft. Like they took what was yours.

But the Gītā teaches: You're not the proprietor. You're the instrument. Your talents, opportunities, circumstances—all given. Your role is to use them skillfully, not to claim ownership.

And when you release that false sense of ownership, envy loses its grip.

Because if you're not the cause of your success, then someone else's success isn't your failure. It's just... their path.

## Living the Teaching: Releasing Comparison

So what does Malik do?

Pretend he's not envious? Suppress the feeling? Force himself to be happy for Sophie?

No.

The Gītā doesn't teach repression. It teaches transformation.

Here's the practice:

### Practice Box

**The Envy Transmutation Practice**

**1. Name the feeling honestly.**
Don't pretend you're not envious. Don't spiritually bypass with ``I'm happy for them.'' Admit it: ``I feel envy. I resent their success.'' Honesty is the first step.

**2. Trace it to false ego.**
Ask: ``What am I believing about myself that makes their success feel like my failure?'' Usually it's: ``I am the cause of my achievements. I deserve recognition.''

**3. Remember: You're the instrument, not the proprietor.**
Your skills, opportunities, results—all given. You did the work, yes. But countless factors beyond your control made it possible. Release ownership.

**4. Wish them well—authentically.**
Not fake positivity. Real recognition: ``Their success doesn't diminish mine. Their path is theirs. Mine is mine.'' Let them have their joy without making it about you.

This is brutal work. Because envy feels justified. Righteous. Like you're defending your worth.

But you're not. You're destroying it.

Every moment you spend resenting someone else's success is a moment you're not building your own. Every ounce of energy you give to envy is energy stolen from your actual work.

The Gītā offers liberation: Let go of being the proprietor. Do your duty. Release attachment to recognition.

Then envy has nothing to feed on.

## The Way Forward: The Honest Acknowledgment

Three weeks after Sophie's promotion, Malik sends her a message:

*Can we grab coffee?*

She responds immediately: *Of course. Tomorrow?*

They meet at the café near the office. It's awkward at first—Malik can feel the distance that's grown between them.

Sophie breaks the silence. "I know you applied for the position too."

Malik nods.

"I'm sorry," she says. "I know that's weird to say. It's not like I took it from you. But I know you wanted it. And I'm sorry it feels... complicated."

Malik takes a breath. "I've been envious. I want to be honest about that. I've spent the last three weeks resenting you. Telling myself you didn't deserve it as much as I did. And I hate that about myself."

Sophie looks surprised. Then sad. "I didn't deserve it more than you. You know that, right? You would have been great in that role."

"Maybe," Malik says. "But that's not the point. The point is... I made your success about me. Like it was something you took from me instead of something you earned. And that's not fair to you."

"Thank you for saying that."

"I don't know if I can just flip a switch and be happy for you. But I can stop making it about me. I can acknowledge that your path is yours and mine is mine. And they're not in competition."

Sophie reaches across the table, touches his hand briefly. "For what it's worth, I'll probably need your advice constantly. You know this company better than anyone."

Malik smiles—for the first time in weeks, genuinely. "I'll send you my consulting rates."

They both laugh. And something eases.

The envy doesn't disappear completely. It's still there, a dull ache when he sees her name on leadership emails.

But it's not consuming him anymore.

Because he stopped feeding it. Stopped telling himself the story that her gain was his loss. Stopped clinging to the belief that he owned his achievements and therefore deserved recognition.

He did the work. He used his skills. He performed his duty.

The results? Those were never his to control.

And in releasing that—in letting go of being the proprietor—he found something better than the promotion.

Freedom.

## Reflection

- Whose success triggers envy in you? What story are you telling yourself about why their achievement diminishes yours?
- Where are you acting as if you own your accomplishments—as if you're the sole cause and therefore entitled to specific results? Can you see the countless factors beyond your control?
- What would change if you genuinely believed that someone else's success has nothing to do with your worth? Could you let them have their joy without making it about you?
