# Chapter 51: Forgetfulness

## The Alarm

Daniel sets three alarms every night.

One to wake up for meditation. One for his morning workout. One for his gratitude practice.

Every morning, he hits snooze on all three.

By 7:30 AM, he's rushed, stressed, and already behind schedule. No meditation. No workout. No gratitude.

Just coffee and crisis mode.

This has been happening for six months.

Six months ago, he went to a retreat. Had a profound experience. Saw clearly—really saw—what mattered. Who he wanted to be. How he wanted to live.

He came home transformed. Committed. Clear.

He was going to meditate daily. Exercise. Journal. Be present with his kids. Stop checking his phone constantly. Live consciously.

For two weeks, he did it all. Perfectly.

Then work got busy. Then his son got sick. Then there was the thing with his mother-in-law. Then just... life.

And slowly, imperceptibly, he forgot.

Not intellectually. He still knows meditation is important. Still believes in presence. Still wants to live consciously.

But somehow, between knowing and doing, there's forgetting.

And now he's back where he started. Sleepwalking through life. Reactive. Stressed. Unconscious.

How does this keep happening?

## The Erosion of Remembrance

We all know what matters.

We know we should be present. Should practice gratitude. Should meditate, exercise, connect with loved ones, live our values.

We've read the books. Been to the workshops. Had the insights.

And yet, we forget.

Not because we're stupid. Because we're human.

And humans are forgetting machines.

We remember what's urgent. The deadline. The email. The crisis.

We forget what's important. The practice. The presence. The purpose.

Daniel remembers to check his phone forty times a day. Forgets to check in with himself once.

Remembers every work meeting. Forgets the promise he made to play catch with his son.

Remembers to stress about the future. Forgets to be present in the now.

This is the default. The gravity. The pull of unconsciousness.

And resisting it requires more than good intentions. It requires structure. Systems. Reminders.

But most of all, it requires understanding *why* we forget.

We forget because remembering is uncomfortable.

Living consciously means facing what we're avoiding. Feeling what we're numbing. Choosing what's hard over what's easy.

Forgetting is self-protection. It lets us off the hook.

"I forgot to meditate" is easier than "I chose not to meditate because sitting with myself is uncomfortable."

"I forgot to be present with my kids" is easier than "I avoided presence because I don't know how to connect."

We don't forget randomly. We forget strategically. What we don't want to face, we conveniently don't remember.

## The Gītā Speaks: The Practice of Remembrance

Kṛṣṇa knows humans forget.

The entire Bhagavad-gītā is about remembering. Remembering who you are. What matters. What's real.

> ``And whoever, at the end of his life, quits his body remembering Me alone at once attains My nature. Of this there is no doubt.''
>
> --- Bhagavad-gītā 8.5

**Remembering Me alone.** The ultimate practice isn't complicated. It's remembrance.

**At the end of life.** If you can remember at death—the moment of ultimate forgetting—you can remember anytime.

**Attains My nature.** You become what you remember. Forget God, become separate. Remember God, realize unity.

But how do you remember? Especially when forgetting is so easy?

Kṛṣṇa gives the method:

> ``Engage your mind always in thinking of Me, become My devotee, offer obeisances to Me and worship Me. Being completely absorbed in Me, surely you will come to Me.''
>
> --- Bhagavad-gītā 9.34

**Always.** Not sometimes. Not when you feel like it. Always.

**Engage your mind.** Active. Deliberate. Constant practice.

**Completely absorbed.** This is the goal. Not perfection. But orientation. Your life pointing toward what you want to remember.

Daniel wants to remember to meditate. To be present. To live consciously.

But he hasn't built his life around remembering. He's built it around reacting.

And what you build your life around is what you'll remember.

Build it around work, you'll remember deadlines. Build it around presence, you'll remember to pause.

The structure determines the remembrance.

## Living the Teaching: Building a Life of Remembrance

Daniel realizes: willpower isn't enough. He needs architecture.

He needs to build remembrance into his environment. His schedule. His systems.

### Practice Box

**The Practice of Constant Remembrance**

**1. Environmental cues.** Put reminders everywhere. Post-it notes. Phone backgrounds. Objects that trigger remembrance. Make forgetting harder than remembering.

**2. Non-negotiable rituals.** Link practice to existing habits. After coffee, meditate. Before bed, journal. After dinner, family time. Use habit stacking.

**3. Accountability structures.** Tell someone. Join a group. Track publicly. We remember what we're accountable for.

**4. Simplify ruthlessly.** Don't try to remember ten things. Remember one. The thing that matters most. Let everything flow from that.

**5. Return immediately.** When you forget (you will), don't spiral. Just return. Forgetting once doesn't matter. Staying forgotten does.

Daniel makes changes.

He puts his meditation cushion in the middle of the floor. Can't miss it. Can't walk past it.

He tells his wife, "I'm meditating at 6 AM. Will you check on me if I'm not up?"

He sets one alarm. Not three. One. And puts the phone across the room so he has to get up.

He simplifies his practice. Not meditation, workout, journaling, gratitude. Just meditation. Ten minutes. That's it.

The rest can wait. But this one thing—sitting, breathing, remembering—this is non-negotiable.

And slowly, it works.

Not perfectly. He still forgets sometimes. Hits snooze. Skips days.

But more often than not, he remembers.

And on the days he forgets, he returns. Same day. No guilt. No spiral. Just return.

Because the practice isn't perfection. It's remembrance.

And remembrance is choosing, again and again, to orient toward what matters.

Even when you forgot yesterday. Even when you'll forget tomorrow.

Today, right now, can you remember?

That's all that's asked.

## The Way Forward: A Life Oriented Toward Remembrance

A year later, Daniel still meditates most mornings.

Not because he's disciplined. Because his life is structured for remembrance.

His son asks, "Dad, why do you sit on that pillow every morning?"

"To remember," Daniel says.

"Remember what?"

"Who I am. What matters. That this moment—right now, with you—is all there is."

His son nods, not fully understanding.

But one morning, Daniel finds him sitting on the cushion. Eyes closed. Breathing.

"What are you doing?" Daniel asks.

"Remembering," his son says. "Like you."

And Daniel realizes: what you practice, you teach. What you remember, you pass on.

His son won't remember every lesson Daniel tries to teach.

But he'll remember what Daniel does. Consistently. Daily. Even imperfectly.

He'll remember that his father sat. Paused. Oriented himself toward something deeper than the rush.

That's the inheritance. Not perfection. Not achievement.

Remembrance.

The practice of returning, again and again, to what's real. What's essential. What matters.

You'll forget. Of course you'll forget.

But you can also remember.

And remember again.

And again.

Until remembrance becomes who you are.

Not what you achieve. Who you are.

## Reflection

- What do you keep forgetting? What practice, promise, or presence keeps slipping away? What's the pattern of your forgetting—what are you avoiding by "forgetting"?
- What structures support your remembrance? Have you built your environment, schedule, and systems to make remembering easier than forgetting?
- What one thing—just one—do you want to remember? Can you build your life around remembering that? What would that look like starting today?
