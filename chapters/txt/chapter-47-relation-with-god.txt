Chapter 47: Relation with God

3 AM

Priya can't sleep.

She lies in bed, eyes open, staring at the ceiling.

Tomorrow is the surgery. They'll remove the tumor. The doctor is optimistic. Ninety percent survival rate. Excellent prognosis.

But that ten percent hangs there. In the dark. In the silence.

She's prayed. Of course she's prayed.

But to what? To whom?

She grew up Hindu. Temple visits with her parents. Prayers to Ganesh before exams. Diwali celebrations. The whole cultural package.

But did she ever actually relate to God? Or did she just perform rituals?

Now, facing the real possibility of death, she realizes: she doesn't know God. She knows about God. Knows the stories. The prayers. The philosophy.

But relationship? That requires vulnerability. Trust. Intimacy.

And Priya has always been self-sufficient. Independent. In control.

Which works great until you lose control. Until you're powerless. Until all you can do is surrender to something bigger and hope it catches you.

God, are you there?

No answer. Just the hum of the ceiling fan. The distant sound of traffic.

I don't know how to do this. I don't know how to trust you. I barely know you.

Still nothing.

And then, softer, more honest: I'm scared.

Reflective Bridge

Most people believe in God. Fewer people actually relate to God.

Because belief is intellectual. Relationship is personal.

Belief says, "There's a God. I acknowledge that."

Relationship says, "God, I need you. I trust you. I'm talking to you right now and I believe you're listening."

The gap between those two is enormous.

Priya has believed in God her whole life. But she's never needed God. Never turned to God in real desperation. Never made herself vulnerable enough to actually relate.

She's prayed for parking spots. For job interviews. For good weather.

But those aren't prayers of relationship. They're transactions. "God, give me this thing, and I'll say thank you."

Real relationship is different. It's not transactional. It's relational.

It's saying, "I don't understand why this is happening. I'm afraid. But I'm choosing to trust you anyway. Not because you promised me a specific outcome. But because I believe you're there."

The Gita Speaks: The Reciprocal Bond

The Bhagavad-gita is fundamentally about relationship with God. Not philosophy about God. Relationship with God.

And Krishna describes this relationship as deeply, startlingly reciprocal.

  "All of them -- as they surrender unto Me -- I reward accordingly. Everyone follows My path in all respects, O son of Prtha."

  -- Bhagavad-gita 4.11

As they surrender unto Me -- I reward accordingly. This is reciprocity. Not indifference. Not one-sided worship into a void. God responds. The degree of surrender determines the degree of response.

Priya has surrendered nothing. She's offered cultural observance, not vulnerability. And she's received accordingly: a sense of tradition, but no intimacy.

But what happens when surrender deepens?

  "To those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give the understanding by which they can come to Me."

  -- Bhagavad-gita 10.10

I give the understanding. God doesn't just receive worship. He responds by giving knowledge -- the inner clarity to approach Him. This isn't distant. This is a teacher leaning toward a student who finally asks a real question.

  "Out of compassion for them, I, dwelling in their hearts, destroy with the shining lamp of knowledge the darkness born of ignorance."

  -- Bhagavad-gita 10.11

Dwelling in their hearts. God isn't far away. He's already present -- inside, waiting. Not distant. Not indifferent. Dwelling.

The shining lamp of knowledge. When Priya cries out in the dark, she thinks she's reaching across an infinite distance. Krishna says the lamp is already in her heart. The darkness isn't God's absence. It's her ignorance of His presence.

Then Krishna reveals something that reframes everything:

  "The living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal, fragmental parts. Due to conditioned life, they are struggling very hard with the six senses, which include the mind."

  -- Bhagavad-gita 15.7

My eternal, fragmental parts. Priya isn't a stranger to God. She's part of God. Not metaphorically. Constitutionally. The relationship isn't something to be built from scratch. It's something to be remembered.

Struggling very hard. Krishna sees the struggle. He doesn't dismiss it. He acknowledges it with the tenderness of someone watching his own child fall and wanting to help.

So how does one fully enter this relationship?

  "One can understand the Supreme Personality as He is only by devotional service. And when one is in full consciousness of the Supreme Lord by such devotion, he can enter into the kingdom of God."

  -- Bhagavad-gita 18.55

Only by devotional service. Not by study alone. Not by ritual alone. By devotion -- love in action.

  "Always think of Me and become My devotee. Worship Me and offer your homage unto Me. Thus you will come to Me without fail."

  -- Bhagavad-gita 18.65

Without fail. The promise is unconditional on God's side. Think of Me. Worship Me. You will come to Me. The only variable is whether Priya will actually turn toward God -- not as a concept, but as a person who is already turned toward her.

Living the Teaching

Priya sits up in bed. Turns on the small lamp.

A mantra comes to mind. One her grandmother used to chant. She hasn't thought of it in years.

Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare

She whispers it. Feels foolish. But continues.

Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare

Not as a formula. As a reaching out. A plea. A connection.

I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know if you're listening. But I need you. I need to believe you're there. That I'm not alone in this.

And something shifts.

Not outside. Inside.

The fear is still there. But it's not the only thing there.

There's something else. A presence. A peace. A sense that maybe -- maybe -- she's not alone.

She thinks of Krishna's words: Dwelling in their hearts. What if He was always there? What if the distance she felt was never His absence, but her own refusal to look inward?

Practice Box

The Practice of Divine Relationship

1. Move from belief to relationship. Stop thinking about God and start talking to God. Out loud. In your mind. In writing. Make it personal.

2. Be honest, not holy. God doesn't need your performance. Bring your real self -- fear, doubt, anger, confusion. Relationship requires honesty.

3. Understand reciprocity. As you surrender, God responds. Start small. Offer a prayer. A mantra. A moment of genuine attention. Watch what comes back.

4. Remember your identity. You are an eternal part of God. The relationship isn't foreign. It's your deepest nature. You're not building something new. You're remembering something ancient.

The surgery goes well. Priya wakes up in recovery. Groggy. Sore. Alive.

The surgeon smiles. "We got it all. Clean margins. You're going to be fine."

Relief floods through her. Gratitude. Joy.

But also something deeper.

She realizes: even if the surgery had gone differently, she would have been okay. Not physically. But spiritually.

Because in those dark hours before dawn, something changed. She stopped relating to God as a concept and started relating to God as... God. Present. Real. Available. Already dwelling in her heart.

And that relationship doesn't depend on outcomes. It's there whether she lives or dies.

The Way Forward

Six months later, Priya is cancer-free.

But she's different.

She still goes to temple. But now it's not routine. It's relationship.

She chants the mantra daily. Not as ritual. As conversation.

She reads the Gita. Not as philosophy. As love letters from someone who has been waiting for her to write back.

A friend asks, "Did the cancer scare make you more religious?"

Priya thinks about it. "Not more religious. More relational."

"What's the difference?"

"Religious is about doing the right things. Relational is about knowing the right person. Krishna says He dwells in the heart and gives understanding to those who worship with love. I finally stopped performing and started relating."

"And you feel God's presence now?"

Priya smiles. "I feel that I was never without it. I just wasn't paying attention. Krishna was always dwelling there. I just had to turn the lamp on."

Because when you're in relationship with God, life's uncertainties don't disappear.

But you face them differently.

Not alone. Not in control. But connected.

To someone who responds as you surrender. Who dwells in your heart. Who sees you as His own. Who promises, without fail, to receive you.

You don't relate to God to get things from God.

You relate to God because that relationship is who you are. You are His eternal part. And coming home to that truth is the deepest peace there is.

Reflection

- Do you believe in God or relate to God? What's the difference in your life? When was the last time you actually talked to God -- not about God?
- Krishna says He rewards as one surrenders. What have you actually surrendered? What would deeper surrender look like for you?
- If you are an eternal part of God, what does that change about how you see yourself, your struggles, your fears? Is the distance you feel God's absence, or your own forgetting?
