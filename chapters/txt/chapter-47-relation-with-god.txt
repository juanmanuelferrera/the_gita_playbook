# Chapter 47: Relation with God

## 3 AM

Priya can't sleep.

She lies in bed, eyes open, staring at the ceiling.

Tomorrow is the surgery. They'll remove the tumor. The doctor is optimistic. Ninety percent survival rate. Excellent prognosis.

But that ten percent hangs there. In the dark. In the silence.

She's prayed. Of course she's prayed.

But to what? To whom?

She grew up Hindu. Temple visits with her parents. Prayers to Ganesh before exams. Diwali celebrations. The whole cultural package.

But did she ever actually relate to God? Or did she just perform rituals?

Now, facing the real possibility of death, she realizes: she doesn't know God. She knows *about* God. Knows the stories. The prayers. The philosophy.

But relationship? That's different.

That requires vulnerability. Trust. Intimacy.

And Priya has always been self-sufficient. Independent. In control.

Which works great until you lose control. Until you're powerless. Until all you can do is surrender to something bigger and hope it catches you.

*God, are you there?*

No answer. Just the hum of the ceiling fan. The distant sound of traffic.

*I don't know how to do this. I don't know how to trust you. I barely know you.*

Still nothing.

And then, softer, more honest: *I'm scared.*

## The Distance We Create

Most people believe in God.

Fewer people actually relate to God.

Because belief is intellectual. Relationship is personal.

Belief says, "There's a God. I acknowledge that."

Relationship says, "God, I need you. I trust you. I'm talking to you right now and I believe you're listening."

The gap between those two is enormous.

Priya has believed in God her whole life. But she's never needed God. Never turned to God in real desperation. Never made herself vulnerable enough to actually relate.

She's prayed for parking spots. For job interviews. For good weather.

But those aren't prayers of relationship. They're cosmic vending machine transactions. "God, give me this thing, and I'll say thank you."

Real relationship is different. It's not transactional. It's relational.

It's saying, "I don't understand why this is happening. I'm afraid. But I'm choosing to trust you anyway. Not because you promised me a specific outcome. But because I believe you're there. You care. You're holding me even when I can't feel it."

That requires surrender. And Priya has never been good at surrender.

Control has always been her comfort. Planning. Preparing. Executing. Achieving.

But you can't control cancer. You can't plan your way through surgery. You can't achieve your way into survival.

All you can do is trust.

And trust requires relationship.

## The Gītā Speaks: Intimacy with the Divine

The Bhagavad-gītā is fundamentally about relationship with God.

Not philosophy about God. Relationship with God.

> ``Engage your mind always in thinking of Me, become My devotee, offer obeisances to Me and worship Me. Being completely absorbed in Me, surely you will come to Me.''
>
> --- Bhagavad-gītā 9.34

**Engage your mind always in thinking of Me.** This isn't casual acknowledgment. It's constant connection.

**Become My devotee.** Not just a believer. A devotee. Someone in love. In relationship.

**Offer obeisances... worship Me.** This is vulnerability. Humility. Acknowledging dependence.

**Being completely absorbed... you will come to Me.** The promise isn't success, health, wealth. The promise is intimacy. Union. Relationship.

Later, Kṛṣṇa reveals the depth of this relationship:

> ``This knowledge is the king of education, the most secret of all secrets. It is the purest knowledge, and because it gives direct perception of the self by realization, it is the perfection of religion. It is everlasting, and it is joyfully performed.''
>
> --- Bhagavad-gītā 9.2

**Direct perception... by realization.** Not theory. Not ritual. Direct experience of God.

**Joyfully performed.** Real relationship with God isn't duty. It's delight. Love expressed freely.

Priya has performed religion. But she's never experienced God.

And now, when she needs that relationship most, she's realizing: you can't manufacture intimacy in a crisis. You build it through consistency.

But maybe—maybe—she can start. Right now. In the dark. Afraid.

Maybe that's exactly when relationship begins.

## Living the Teaching: Opening to Intimacy

Priya sits up in bed. Turns on the small lamp. Opens her phone.

She's not looking for information. She's looking for... she doesn't know what.

A mantra comes to mind. One her grandmother used to chant. She hasn't thought of it in years.

*Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare*

She whispers it. Feels foolish. But continues.

*Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare*

Not as a formula. As a reaching out. A plea. A connection.

*I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know if you're listening. But I need you. I need to believe you're there. That I'm not alone in this.*

The words keep coming. The mantra. The prayer. The vulnerability.

And something shifts.

Not outside. Inside.

She can't explain it. But the fear—it's still there. But it's not the only thing there.

There's something else. A presence. A peace. A sense that maybe—maybe—she's not alone.

### Practice Box

**The Practice of Divine Relationship**

**1. Move from belief to relationship.** Stop thinking about God and start talking to God. Out loud. In your mind. In writing. Make it personal.

**2. Be honest, not holy.** God doesn't need your performance. Bring your real self—fear, doubt, anger, confusion. Relationship requires honesty.

**3. Practice presence, not just prayer.** Don't just ask for things. Sit with God. Chant. Meditate. Be in the presence without agenda.

**4. Surrender control.** Relationship requires vulnerability. Admit you're not in control. Ask for help. Trust the outcome to God.

**5. Cultivate consistency.** You can't build relationship in crisis alone. Daily connection—even five minutes—builds intimacy over time.

The surgery goes well. Priya wakes up in recovery. Groggy. Sore. Alive.

The surgeon smiles. "We got it all. Clean margins. You're going to be fine."

Relief floods through her. Gratitude. Joy.

But also something deeper.

She realizes: even if the surgery had gone differently, she would have been okay. Not physically. But spiritually.

Because in those dark hours before dawn, something changed.

She stopped relating to God as a concept and started relating to God as... God. Present. Real. Available.

And that relationship—that connection—doesn't depend on outcomes. It doesn't require good news. It's there whether she lives or dies.

That's the promise. Not that everything will work out how she wants. But that she's never alone. Never abandoned. Always held.

## The Way Forward: The Relationship That Sustains

Six months later, Priya is cancer-free.

But she's different.

She still goes to temple. But now it's not routine. It's relationship.

She chants the mantra daily. Not as ritual. As conversation.

She reads the Gītā. Not as philosophy. As love letters from God.

A friend asks, "Did the cancer scare make you more religious?"

Priya thinks about it. "Not more religious. More relational."

"What's the difference?"

"Religious is about doing the right things. Relational is about knowing the right person."

"And you know God now?"

Priya smiles. "I'm getting to know God. It's... it's like any relationship. It takes time. Honesty. Presence. But it's real. And it changes everything."

Because when you're in relationship with God, life's uncertainties don't disappear.

But you face them differently.

Not alone. Not in control. But connected.

To something—Someone—infinitely bigger than your fear. Infinitely more loving than your doubt. Infinitely more present than your loneliness.

You don't relate to God to get things from God.

You relate to God because God is the only relationship that survives everything.

Success. Failure. Health. Sickness. Life. Death.

Everything else is temporary. Conditional. Uncertain.

But this relationship? This intimacy with the Divine?

It's eternal. Unbreakable. Real.

And once you taste it—really taste it—nothing else satisfies the same way.

## Reflection

- Do you believe in God or relate to God? What's the difference in your life? When was the last time you actually talked to God, not about God?
- What would it mean to be honest with God—to bring your real fear, doubt, anger, confusion—instead of performing holiness? What scares you about that vulnerability?
- Are you trying to use God or know God? What do you want from this relationship—outcomes or intimacy? Which one sustains when life falls apart?
