# Chapter 33: Discriminated

## The Room Where It Happens

Aisha walks into the conference room and feels it immediately.

The shift. The slight pause in conversation. The way eyes flicker toward her, then away.

She's the only Black woman in the room. Again.

The meeting is about the new product launch. She's the lead designer—her work, her vision, her strategy. But when the VP starts asking questions, he directs them to Tom. Her white, male colleague. Who works /for/ her.

"Tom, walk us through the design rationale."

Tom glances at Aisha, uncomfortable. "Actually, Aisha led this. She should—"

"Right, right," the VP interrupts. "But give us the technical overview."

Tom does. Because what else can he do?

And Aisha sits there, smiling professionally, while her work is discussed as if she's not in the room.

This isn't new. It's happened in every company she's worked for. Every meeting. Every presentation. The subtle erosion of her presence, her authority, her expertise.

Not overtly racist. No one uses slurs. No one tells her she doesn't belong.

They just... act like she's not there. Ask her male colleagues to explain her ideas. Question her decisions more than anyone else's. Assume she's junior when she's senior. Compliment her for being "articulate" like it's surprising.

Death by a thousand cuts.

And the worst part? When she tries to name it, she's told she's being sensitive. Reading into things. Playing the victim.

So she stops naming it. Swallows it. Performs twice as hard to get half the recognition.

And slowly, imperceptibly, she's eroding from the inside out.

## The Weight of Invisibility

Discrimination doesn't always announce itself.

Sometimes it's loud—hateful, overt, undeniable. But more often, it's quiet. Insidious. A pattern you feel but can't quite prove.

The way your résumé gets passed over despite your qualifications. The way your ideas are ignored until a man repeats them. The way you're followed in stores, questioned by security, assumed to be the help instead of the guest.

It's exhausting. Not just the discrimination itself, but the gaslighting that follows.

*Are you sure that's what happened?*
*Maybe they just didn't see you.*
*You're being too sensitive.*

Until you start questioning yourself. *Am I imagining this? Am I making it about race/gender/identity when it's not?*

But you're not imagining it. The data proves it. The patterns prove it. Your lived experience proves it.

And yet you're expected to smile. To not make people uncomfortable. To be grateful for the scraps of recognition you do get. To prove you're not angry, not bitter, not the "problem."

Aisha knows this dance well. She's perfected it. The professional mask. The strategic silence. The careful modulation of her tone so she's not "aggressive."

But the cost is immense.

Because every time she swallows her truth, she loses a piece of herself. Every time she performs acceptability, she betrays her dignity.

The Gītā speaks to this. Not about discrimination specifically—but about dignity in the face of injustice.

## The Gītā Speaks: Dignity Beyond Recognition

Arjuna faces a kind of discrimination too. Not racial or gendered, but existential.

He's a warrior. The greatest archer alive. And yet he's being asked to fight his own family—people who should honor him but instead stand against him.

He's being denied the basic dignity of his role, his identity, his worth.

And he breaks. "I will not fight," he says. "What's the point?"

But Kṛṣṇa's response isn't sympathy. It's a challenge:

> ``The humble sage, by virtue of true knowledge, sees with equal vision a learned and gentle brāhmaṇa, a cow, an elephant, a dog, and a dog-eater.''
>
> --- Bhagavad-gītā 5.18

At first glance, this seems irrelevant to Aisha's struggle. But look closer.

Kṛṣṇa is saying: The wise person sees the eternal soul beyond the temporary designations. Beyond caste, species, status, appearance.

The discrimination Aisha faces comes from people who can't see her soul—only her skin. Who can't recognize her expertise—only her gender. Who are trapped in the illusion that external markers determine worth.

But here's the radical part: That's /their/ blindness. Not her deficiency.

The Gītā doesn't tell Aisha to accept the discrimination. It tells her to recognize its source: ignorance. People treating her as less than are operating from /avidyā/—a fundamental misunderstanding of reality.

And then Kṛṣṇa says this:

> ``One who is equal to friends and enemies, who is equipoised in honor and dishonor, heat and cold, happiness and distress, fame and infamy, who is always free from contamination, always silent and satisfied with anything, who doesn't care for any residence, who is fixed in knowledge and engaged in devotional service—such a person is very dear to Me.''
>
> --- Bhagavad-gītā 12.18-19

"Equal in honor and dishonor."

This doesn't mean accepting injustice passively. It means: Your worth is not determined by whether others recognize it.

Aisha's dignity doesn't come from the VP acknowledging her. It comes from knowing—deeply—that her worth is inherent, eternal, beyond anyone's power to grant or deny.

That's not spiritual bypassing. That's the foundation for effective resistance.

## Living the Teaching: Dignity in Action

So what does Aisha do?

Smile and bear it? Internalize the oppression? Pretend it doesn't hurt?

No.

The Gītā doesn't teach passivity. It teaches /sthitaprajñā/—steadiness of mind. Acting from inner dignity rather than reactive pain.

Here's the practice:

### Practice Box

**The Dignity Practice**

**1. Name the injustice clearly.**
Don't gaslight yourself. If you're being discriminated against, name it. To yourself. To trusted others. To those with power when it's safe. Truth first.

**2. Separate their blindness from your worth.**
Their inability to see you is their limitation, not your deficiency. You are not diminished by their ignorance. Remember: the soul is beyond their categories.

**3. Act from dignity, not reaction.**
Respond strategically, not reflexively. Sometimes that means speaking up. Sometimes it means documenting. Sometimes it means leaving. But choose from strength, not wound.

**4. Preserve your inner ground.**
Don't let them make you doubt yourself. Your expertise is real. Your worth is inherent. Their recognition is not required for you to stand in truth.

This is hard. Impossibly hard.

Because the Gītā's teaching can sound like: "Just don't let it bother you." But that's not what it's saying.

It's saying: Know your worth so deeply that their failure to see it doesn't shatter you. Then act—strategically, powerfully—from that unshakeable ground.

Not spiritual bypassing. Spiritual resistance.

## The Way Forward: The Line in the Sand

After the meeting, Aisha walks back to her office. Tom follows.

"That was bullshit," he says. "I tried to redirect—"

"I know. Thank you."

"Are you going to say something? To HR? To the VP?"

Aisha sits down. Breathes. Feels the familiar calculation: *Is it worth it? Will it change anything? Or will I just be labeled as difficult?*

Then she realizes: She's been asking the wrong question.

Not: "Will this change them?"

But: "Can I live with my silence?"

She picks up her phone. Sends an email to the VP, cc'ing HR:

*During today's meeting, you repeatedly directed questions about my project to Tom instead of to me, despite my role as lead designer. This is not the first time this has happened. I'm requesting a conversation about how to ensure project leads are recognized and included in discussions about their own work.*

Professional. Clear. Documented.

Her hand shakes slightly as she hits send.

Tom watches. "You think he'll respond?"

"Probably not the way I want," Aisha says. "But I'm not doing this for him. I'm doing it for me."

The response comes two hours later. Defensive. "I didn't mean to overlook you. Just trying to keep the meeting moving."

No apology. No acknowledgment.

Aisha expected this. But she feels lighter anyway.

Because she named it. Stood in her truth. Refused to gaslight herself to make him comfortable.

The discrimination won't stop. Not today. Maybe not ever in this company.

But something shifted: She stopped eroding.

That night, she updates her résumé. Starts reaching out to her network. Maybe she stays. Maybe she leaves. But either way, she'll do it from dignity.

Not because anyone gave her permission.

But because her worth—her eternal, unshakeable worth—was never theirs to grant in the first place.

## Reflection

- Where are you experiencing discrimination—overt or subtle? Have you been gaslighting yourself to avoid seeing it clearly?
- How much of your energy goes to seeking recognition from people who are fundamentally unable or unwilling to see you? What would change if you stopped performing for their approval?
- Can you distinguish between accepting injustice and recognizing that your worth is independent of their recognition? What strategic action becomes possible when you act from dignity rather than wound?
