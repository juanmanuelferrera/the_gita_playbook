Chapter 33: Discriminated

Opening Story

Aisha walks into the conference room and feels it immediately.

The shift. The slight pause in conversation. The way eyes flicker toward her, then away.

She is the only Black woman in the room. Again.

The meeting is about the new product launch. She is the lead designer. Her work, her vision, her strategy. But when the VP starts asking questions, he directs them to Tom. Her white, male colleague. Who works for her.

"Tom, walk us through the design rationale."

Tom glances at Aisha, uncomfortable. "Actually, Aisha led this. She should--"

"Right, right," the VP interrupts. "But give us the technical overview."

Tom does. Because what else can he do?

And Aisha sits there, smiling professionally, while her work is discussed as if she is not in the room.

This is not new. It has happened in every company she has worked for. Every meeting. Every presentation. The subtle erosion of her presence, her authority, her expertise.

Not overtly racist. No one uses slurs. No one tells her she does not belong.

They just act like she is not there. Ask her male colleagues to explain her ideas. Question her decisions more than anyone else's. Assume she is junior when she is senior. Compliment her for being "articulate" like it is surprising.

Death by a thousand cuts.

And the worst part? When she tries to name it, she is told she is being sensitive. Reading into things. Playing the victim.

So she stops naming it. Swallows it. Performs twice as hard to get half the recognition.

And slowly, imperceptibly, she is eroding from the inside out.

Reflective Bridge

Discrimination does not always announce itself.

Sometimes it is loud, hateful, overt, undeniable. But more often, it is quiet. Insidious. A pattern you feel but cannot quite prove.

The way your resume gets passed over despite your qualifications. The way your ideas are ignored until a man repeats them. The way you are followed in stores, questioned by security, assumed to be the help instead of the guest.

It is exhausting. Not just the discrimination itself, but the gaslighting that follows.

Are you sure that's what happened? Maybe they just didn't see you. You're being too sensitive.

Until you start questioning yourself. Am I imagining this? Am I making it about race when it is not?

But you are not imagining it. The data proves it. The patterns prove it. Your lived experience proves it.

And yet you are expected to smile. To not make people uncomfortable. To be grateful for the scraps of recognition you do get.

Aisha knows this dance well. She has perfected it. The professional mask. The strategic silence. The careful modulation of her tone so she is not "aggressive."

But the cost is immense. Every time she swallows her truth, she loses a piece of herself.

The Gita speaks to this. Not about discrimination specifically, but about dignity in the face of injustice. About a vision so clear it sees through every false designation the world imposes.

The Gita Speaks: Equal Vision

Krishna offers a radical standard for seeing reality as it truly is:

"The humble sage, by virtue of true knowledge, sees with equal vision a learned and gentle brahmana, a cow, an elephant, a dog and a dog-eater outcaste."
  -- Bhagavad-gita 5.18

Look carefully at that list. It contains every category the ancient world used to sort beings into hierarchies: the scholar, the animal, the untouchable. And Krishna says the wise person sees through all of it. Every designation. Every category. Every hierarchy.

The discrimination Aisha faces comes from people who cannot see her soul. They see only her skin. Only her gender. They are trapped in the illusion that external markers determine worth.

But that is their blindness. Not her deficiency.

And Krishna takes this further:

"Those whose minds are established in sameness and equanimity have already conquered the conditions of birth and death. They are flawless like Brahman, and thus they are already situated in Brahman."
  -- Bhagavad-gita 5.19

The person established in equanimity has conquered the very conditions that produce discrimination: the illusion that birth determines value. The person who sees with equal vision is not merely tolerant. They have transcended the entire framework of hierarchy. They are, Krishna says, flawless.

Which means the VP who cannot see Aisha is not merely rude. He is spiritually impoverished. He has not conquered the most basic illusion.

And what does true equality look like in practice?

"He is a perfect yogi who, by comparison to his own self, sees the true equality of all beings, both in their happiness and distress, O Arjuna!"
  -- Bhagavad-gita 6.32

The perfect yogi feels your happiness as their happiness. Your distress as their distress. This is not abstract philosophy. It is the highest standard of human consciousness. And anyone who discriminates has fallen from it entirely.

But here is the part that speaks most directly to Aisha. Krishna himself models the equal vision he teaches:

"I envy no one, nor am I partial to anyone. I am equal to all. But whoever renders service unto Me in devotion is a friend, is in Me, and I am also a friend to him."
  -- Bhagavad-gita 9.29

God himself is equal to all. Not partial. Not biased. Not impressed by caste, skin color, gender, or title. The only distinction Krishna makes is devotion, and that is available to every being equally.

This does not tell Aisha to accept the discrimination. It tells her to recognize its source: ignorance. And it tells her that her worth is not determined by whether the VP acknowledges it. Her worth is inherent, eternal, recognized by the very source of all existence.

Living the Teaching

So what does Aisha do?

Smile and bear it? Internalize the oppression? Pretend it does not hurt?

No. The Gita does not teach passivity. It teaches steadiness of mind. Acting from inner dignity rather than reactive pain.

Practice Box

The Equal Vision Practice

1. Name the injustice clearly. Do not gaslight yourself. If you are being discriminated against, name it. To yourself. To trusted others. To those with power when it is safe. The person who sees with equal vision names inequality. They do not pretend it is not there.

2. Recognize their blindness, not your deficiency. Their inability to see you is their spiritual poverty, not your failing. They have not conquered the conditions of birth and death. They are still trapped in the illusion that external markers determine worth. That is their problem.

3. Act from dignity, not reaction. Respond strategically, not reflexively. Sometimes that means speaking up. Sometimes it means documenting. Sometimes it means leaving. But choose from strength, not wound. The person established in equanimity acts from a conquered mind.

4. Remember: God is equal to all. Your worth is not determined by the VP, the company, or the culture. It is inherent. Recognized by the source of reality itself. Stand in that knowledge.

The Way Forward

After the meeting, Aisha walks back to her office. Tom follows.

"That was unacceptable," he says. "I tried to redirect--"

"I know. Thank you."

"Are you going to say something? To HR? To the VP?"

Aisha sits down. Breathes. Feels the familiar calculation: Is it worth it? Will it change anything? Or will I just be labeled as difficult?

Then she realizes she has been asking the wrong question.

Not: "Will this change them?"

But: "Can I live with my silence?"

She thinks about equal vision. Not hers. Theirs. Their inability to see her. Their spiritual poverty. Their failure to recognize what Krishna says is obvious: that every being is equal.

She does not need them to see her in order to know her own worth. But she does need to name the injustice. Because the person established in equanimity does not pretend inequality is acceptable. They name it from a place of unshakeable ground.

She picks up her phone. Sends an email to the VP, copying HR:

During today's meeting, you repeatedly directed questions about my project to Tom instead of to me, despite my role as lead designer. This is not the first time this has happened. I am requesting a conversation about how to ensure project leads are recognized and included in discussions about their own work.

Professional. Clear. Documented.

Her hand shakes slightly as she hits send.

Tom watches. "You think he'll respond?"

"Probably not the way I want," Aisha says. "But I'm not doing this for him. I'm doing it for me."

The response comes two hours later. Defensive. "I didn't mean to overlook you. Just trying to keep the meeting moving."

No apology. No acknowledgment.

Aisha expected this. But she feels lighter anyway.

Because she named it. Stood in her truth. Refused to gaslight herself to make him comfortable.

The discrimination will not stop. Not today. Maybe not ever in this company.

But something shifted: She stopped eroding.

That night, she updates her resume. Starts reaching out to her network. Maybe she stays. Maybe she leaves. But either way, she will do it from dignity.

Not because anyone gave her permission.

But because her worth, her eternal, unshakeable worth, was never theirs to grant in the first place. God is equal to all. And so is she.

Reflection

- Where are you experiencing discrimination, overt or subtle? Have you been gaslighting yourself to avoid seeing it clearly?
- Can you distinguish between their blindness and your worth? What would change if you stopped performing for the approval of people who cannot see you?
- What strategic action becomes possible when you act from the knowledge that your worth is inherent, equal, and recognized by the source of all existence?
