# Chapter 39: Respect

## The Dismissal

Carlos has worked at the hospital for twenty-two years.

He's not a doctor. Not a nurse. He's in environmental services—the official term for custodian.

He mops floors. Empties trash. Cleans rooms after patients are discharged.

Most people don't see him. And when they do, they don't really look.

But Carlos sees everything. The frantic energy of the ER at 3 AM. The quiet grief of families saying goodbye. The exhausted nurses who nod thank you when he restocks the supply closet they forgot to check.

He knows this hospital like he knows his own home.

One afternoon, a new administrator starts her rounds. Young. Ivy League MBA. Here to "optimize operations."

She watches Carlos clean a room. Frowns. "This is inefficient. You're using too much time per room."

Carlos looks up. "Ma'am, this is ICU. These rooms need—"

"I've reviewed the data," she interrupts. "You're 20% slower than the benchmark. We need to bring that down."

"The benchmark doesn't account for—"

"I'm not interested in excuses. Just results. Can you improve, or do we need to find someone who can?"

Carlos doesn't say anything. He just nods. Finishes his work. Moves to the next room.

But something inside him hardens.

## The Hunger for Dignity

Everyone wants to be seen. Really seen.

Not just acknowledged as a function—the person who cleans, who serves, who fixes, who delivers.

But recognized as a human being with skill, with care, with value that transcends their role.

Respect isn't about status. It's about dignity.

Carlos doesn't need the administrator to praise him. He doesn't need her to understand the twenty-two years of institutional knowledge he carries.

He just needs her to see him as more than a number on a spreadsheet. As someone whose work matters. Whose perspective might actually be worth hearing.

But she didn't.

And that dismissal—it cuts deeper than criticism. Deeper than being told he's slow.

Because criticism implies you're seen well enough to be evaluated. Dismissal means you're not seen at all.

This is what disrespect does. It erases. It reduces. It says, "You don't matter enough to be worth my attention, my courtesy, my basic human acknowledgment."

And when you're on the receiving end? It's corrosive.

Carlos goes home that night and tells his wife. She's furious. "You should report her. That's disrespectful. Unprofessional."

But Carlos just shrugs. "She'll be gone in a year. They always are. Consultants. Administrators. They come, they 'optimize,' they leave. The hospital stays. We stay."

"That doesn't make it okay," his wife says.

Carlos knows she's right. But what's he supposed to do?

## The Gītā Speaks: Honor in All Beings

The Bhagavad-gītā has a radical teaching about respect.

It's not earned by status. It's owed by virtue of existence.

> ``The humble sages, by virtue of true knowledge, see with equal vision a learned and gentle brāhmaṇa, a cow, an elephant, a dog and a dog-eater.''
>
> --- Bhagavad-gītā 5.18

This isn't saying everyone is the same. A scholar isn't identical to a dog. A CEO isn't identical to a custodian.

But the *soul*—the essential consciousness animating each being—is equally valuable.

The wise see beyond the surface. Beyond role, title, function. They see the person. The living being worthy of dignity.

Later, Kṛṣṇa makes this even clearer:

> ``One who is not envious but is a kind friend to all living entities, who does not think himself a proprietor and is free from false ego, who is equal in both happiness and distress, who is tolerant, always satisfied, self-controlled, and engaged in devotional service with determination, his mind and intelligence fixed on Me—such a devotee of Mine is very dear to Me.''
>
> --- Bhagavad-gītā 12.13-14

**A kind friend to all living entities.** Not just the powerful. Not just the important. All.

**Free from false ego.** The ego says, "I'm better than you. My role is more valuable. My time is more important." The wise person knows better.

**Equal in both happiness and distress.** Doesn't need to diminish others to feel elevated. Doesn't need to be respected to give respect.

Respect isn't transactional. It's not "I'll respect you if you respect me." It's foundational. Because every being—regardless of their role, their productivity, their value to you—carries consciousness. Carries life. Carries dignity.

And that's not something to be earned. It's something to be honored.

## Living the Teaching: Practicing Respect

A week later, the administrator is back. She's shadowing Carlos again, clipboard in hand.

But this time, something's different.

She watches him work. Really watches. And after a few rooms, she asks, "Why do you spend extra time in ICU rooms?"

Carlos pauses. Usually, this is where he gets told he's wrong. But she's actually asking.

"ICU patients are fragile," he says. "Extra cleaning protocols. And families—they're scared. If they see someone being careless, it adds to their stress. So I go slower. I'm thorough. They notice."

The administrator writes something down. "How long have you worked here?"

"Twenty-two years."

She looks up. "So you've seen administrators come and go."

Carlos allows himself a small smile. "A few."

She nods. "I'm sure you have. I'm sorry I dismissed your input last week. I was focused on the data and missed the context. That was my mistake."

Carlos blinks. He wasn't expecting that.

"I'd like to hear more," she continues. "About what works here. What doesn't. You've got institutional knowledge I don't have."

And just like that, he's not invisible anymore.

### Practice Box

**The Practice of Equal Vision**

**1. See the person, not the role.** Before you interact with anyone—cashier, CEO, stranger—pause. Remind yourself: this is a conscious being with thoughts, struggles, dignity. Not a function.

**2. Give what you want to receive.** Don't wait to be respected before offering respect. Lead with it. Even when—especially when—it's not returned.

**3. Listen like it matters.** When someone speaks, listen fully. Not to respond. Not to evaluate. To understand. This is respect in action.

**4. Honor expertise in all forms.** Someone who's done a job for twenty years knows things you don't. Respect that. Ask questions. Learn.

**5. Check your ego.** When you're tempted to dismiss someone, ask why. Is it their actual incompetence? Or your need to feel superior? Be honest.

Carlos starts meeting with the administrator weekly. She asks questions. He shares what he's learned. Together, they redesign some of the workflows—not to speed things up, but to reduce waste while maintaining quality.

The administrator credits him in her report. She makes sure his supervisor knows his contribution.

It doesn't erase the initial dismissal. But it shows that people can learn. Can change. Can choose to see what they initially missed.

Respect isn't automatic. But it's always possible.

## The Way Forward: Dignity Is Not Negotiable

Months later, the administrator is still there. Carlos jokes that she might actually stick around.

One day, she asks him, "How do you do it? Stay patient with all the people who've talked down to you over the years?"

Carlos thinks about it.

"I decided a long time ago," he says, "that my dignity doesn't depend on whether people see it. It's there whether they acknowledge it or not."

"But doesn't it hurt?" she asks. "Being dismissed?"

"Of course it does," Carlos says. "But if I tie my respect to whether others give it, I lose twice. Once when they dismiss me. And again when I diminish myself."

The administrator nods slowly. "That's wisdom."

Carlos smiles. "That's survival."

But it's also truth.

Respect—real respect—isn't given by others. It's inherent. It's the recognition that every being, regardless of role or status, carries the same fundamental consciousness.

You can offer it freely. You can withhold it from others. But you can't lose it from yourself—unless you give it away.

And the person who respects everyone, regardless of whether it's returned?

That person walks through the world whole. Undiminished. Free.

Not because everyone sees them. But because they see everyone. Including themselves.

## Reflection

- Who do you dismiss without realizing it? The person who serves your coffee? The person who cleans your office? Who have you reduced to a function instead of seeing as a human being?
- When you withhold respect from others, what does that reveal about your own sense of worth? Are you more focused on maintaining superiority than offering dignity?
- Can you respect yourself regardless of whether others see your value? Where does your dignity really come from—external validation or internal knowing?
