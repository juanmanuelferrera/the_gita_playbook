# Chapter 11: Sorrow and Regret

## The Unchangeable Past

Daniel's father died on a Tuesday.

Heart attack. Sudden. No warning. No chance to say goodbye.

But that's not what haunts Daniel three years later.

What haunts him is the argument they had the week before. Over something stupid—politics, maybe, or Daniel's career choices, one of those recurring battles they'd been having for twenty years. Daniel had hung up mid-sentence. Didn't call back.

Was planning to. Eventually. When he cooled down. When his father cooled down.

But eventually never came.

Now Daniel sits in the same kitchen where they used to argue, going through his father's things, and the regret is physical. Heavy. It presses on his chest, makes it hard to breathe, turns ordinary objects into accusations.

/If only I'd called back./

/If only I'd been less defensive./

/If only I'd said I loved him before hanging up./

/If only I'd known./

But he didn't know. And he didn't call. And now his father is gone and the past is unchangeable and Daniel is left with this: a sorrow that never softens and a regret that offers no resolution.

"You can't change what happened," his therapist tells him.

Daniel knows that. He knows it intellectually. But knowing doesn't help.

Because the past isn't just /behind/ him. It's /in/ him. Alive. Present. Replaying on an endless loop. And every replay ends the same way: with the thing he can never fix.

## Making Peace With What Cannot Be Changed

Regret is a strange torment.

Unlike fear (which points to the future) or anger (which demands action), regret focuses entirely on the past. On what you did or didn't do. On opportunities missed, words unsaid, choices you can't unmake.

And the cruel paradox: the more you regret something, the more impossible it becomes to change it.

Because regret keeps you locked in the moment you wish you could redo. You replay it constantly—not to understand it, but to /fix/ it. To go back and choose differently. To undo the damage. To erase the mistake.

But you can't.

The past is fixed. Immutable. Beyond your reach.

And so regret becomes its own kind of prison. You're free to act in the present, but you're emotionally chained to a moment that no longer exists except in memory. You punish yourself for something that can never be corrected. You carry a debt that can never be paid.

The Bhagavad-gītā doesn't tell you to simply "let it go" or "forgive yourself" as if these are switches you can flip.

Instead, it points to something deeper:

Your relationship with time itself.

What if the past—though fixed in memory—isn't as solid as it seems? What if your essential self exists /outside/ the time stream that regret tries to trap you in? What if the moment you regret was always impermanent, always conditional, always less than ultimate?

This isn't spiritual bypassing. It's not pretending the moment didn't matter or that harm wasn't done.

It's recognizing that the past is a /thought/ you're having /now/. And thoughts can be related to differently—even when they point to real events.

## The Gītā Speaks: The Eternal Now

Arjuna stands paralyzed by regret before the battle even begins.

He's already played it forward: If I fight, people I love will die. If they die, I'll regret it forever. Better to not act at all. Better to avoid creating that future regret.

But Kṛṣṇa points to something Arjuna is missing:

> ``Never was there a time when I did not exist, nor you, nor all these kings; nor in the future shall any of us cease to be.''
>
> --- Bhagavad-gītā 2.12

Before the moment you regret happened, you existed.

After that moment passed, you still existed.

And /right now/—in this present moment where you're experiencing the regret—you exist.

The moment itself came and went. It's not happening anymore. The only place it exists is in memory, in thought, in the story you tell about it.

But /you/—the eternal witness, the conscious self—are here. Now. Always now.

Kṛṣṇa continues:

> ``As the embodied soul continuously passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death. A sober person is not bewildered by such a change.''
>
> --- Bhagavad-gītā 2.13

The body changes. Circumstances change. Moments come and go. Childhood, youth, old age, death—all temporary. All passing through.

But the witness remains.

The one who remembers the past /is not stuck in the past/. You're here. Now. Aware.

And in this awareness—in this eternal present—there's space to relate to the past differently. Not to erase it. Not to pretend it doesn't hurt. But to recognize that the self you actually are is not imprisoned by it.

Regret says: That moment defines you. You are forever the person who made that mistake, who missed that chance, who failed in that way.

The Gītā says: That moment was temporary. You are eternal. The moment passed through you. You didn't pass through it and get stuck there.

One more verse:

> ``That which pervades the entire body you should know to be indestructible. No one is able to destroy that imperishable soul.''
>
> --- Bhagavad-gītā 2.17

The regret can't destroy you.

The sorrow can't destroy you.

Even the actual event you regret—however painful, however real—couldn't destroy the eternal self that witnessed it.

You're still here. Still conscious. Still free to choose how you relate to what cannot be changed.

## Living the Teaching: Honoring the Past Without Being Imprisoned by It

Daniel starts a practice his grief counselor suggests.

Every morning, he sits quietly and acknowledges three things:

/The argument with my father happened. That's real./

/I wish I'd called him back. That's real./

/I am not defined by that moment. Also real./

At first, the third statement feels like a lie. Like he's trying to let himself off the hook.

But slowly, he begins to understand the distinction.

Honoring the regret doesn't mean living in it. He can acknowledge the wish—/I wish I'd called back/—without demanding the impossible: that the past be different.

He can hold the sorrow—/I miss him/—without turning it into self-punishment.

He can take responsibility—/I was defensive, I hung up/—without concluding that this defines his entire relationship with his father or his worth as a son.

One day, going through old photos, he finds a picture of his father laughing. Taken maybe five years before he died. Daniel remembers that day—a good day, nothing special, just the two of them working on the old car in the garage.

And he realizes something:

The regret has been so loud that it drowned out everything else. But that argument—painful as it was—was /one moment/ in a relationship spanning forty-three years. There were thousands of other moments. Moments of connection, laughter, love. Ordinary moments where nothing went wrong.

The regret wanted him to reduce the entire relationship to that final week. To let one unresolved conflict define everything.

But it doesn't have to.

He can hold both: the regret /and/ the love. The sorrow /and/ the gratitude. The wish for what didn't happen /and/ the appreciation for what did.

The past remains unchangeable.

But his relationship to it can change.

### Practice Box

**The Practice of Living With Regret**

1. **Acknowledge what's real.** Name the regret clearly: ``I wish I had done X.'' or ``I regret that Y happened.'' Don't suppress it. Don't spiritually bypass it. Let it be true.

2. **Recognize the unchangeable.** Say it: ``The past cannot be changed.'' This isn't resignation. It's reality. Fighting with unchangeable facts is suffering.

3. **Separate self from moment.** You are not that moment. You are the eternal witness who experienced that moment—and thousands of others. Don't let regret collapse your entire identity into one event.

4. **Ask: What can I learn?** Regret has information. What does it tell you about your values? About what matters to you? About how you want to live going forward? Extract the lesson without drowning in self-punishment.

5. **Make amends if possible, accept if not.** If you can apologize, repair, or take action—do it. But if the moment is truly past and irretrievable, practice accepting what cannot be changed while still changing what you can: how you act from this moment forward.

The past is fixed. You are not. You can't rewrite history. But you can write what comes next.

## The Way Forward: Writing the Next Chapter

Five years after his father's death, Daniel is at a family gathering when his nephew—seventeen, angry, in the middle of a fight with his own father—storms out.

Daniel finds him in the driveway, sitting in his car.

"Want to talk?" Daniel asks.

The kid shrugs. "He doesn't get it. He never gets it."

Daniel leans against the car. Chooses his words carefully.

"Can I tell you something?"

"Sure."

"I had a fight with my dad, week before he died. Stupid fight. I hung up on him. Never called back. Then he was gone."

The kid looks at him. "Damn."

"Yeah. And I regretted it for years. Still do, sometimes. But you know what I learned?"

"What?"

"That I can't change that moment. But I can change this one. And so can you."

The kid is quiet.

Daniel continues: "You don't have to make up with your dad right now. You don't even have to want to. But you get to choose how this goes. Whether this fight is the last word, or just one fight in a longer story. That choice is yours."

The nephew thinks about it. Then: "I'm still mad."

"You can be mad and still talk to him."

"Yeah?"

"Yeah."

Ten minutes later, the kid goes back inside. Daniel doesn't know if he'll talk to his father tonight. Maybe he will. Maybe he won't.

But Daniel knows this: he just did something his own regret couldn't do. He couldn't go back and call his father. But he could stand in this driveway and offer his nephew a choice. Could turn the regret into wisdom. The sorrow into service.

The past is still unchangeable.

But the present—right now, this moment—is wide open.

And in that openness, Daniel finds something he thought regret had stolen forever:

The ability to make a difference. To act with love. To be the person his father would have wanted him to be—not by erasing the argument, but by learning from it.

The regret doesn't disappear.

But it's no longer a prison.

It's a teacher. And the lesson is this:

You can't fix yesterday. But you can honor it by living today with more awareness, more compassion, more presence.

The past is past.

But you—the eternal witness—are here. Now. Free to choose.

## Reflection

- What past moment do you wish you could change? What would you do differently if you could?
- Can you separate your essential self from that one moment? Can you see yourself as larger than any single regret?
- How might your regret—if you stopped fighting it and started learning from it—change how you act today?
