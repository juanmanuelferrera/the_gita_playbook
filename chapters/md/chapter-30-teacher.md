# Chapter 30: Teacher

## The Student Who Won't Learn

Professor Lina Zhang stands at the front of the lecture hall, mid-sentence, when she sees it again.

Brian. Third row. Phone out. Not even pretending to pay attention.

This is the fifth class in a row.

She pauses. Twenty-three other students look up, waiting. Brian doesn't notice.

"Brian," she says.

He glances up, startled. Pockets the phone. "Sorry, Professor Zhang."

She continues the lecture. But her mind is elsewhere.

Brian is failing. Not just her class—everything. She's seen the emails from other faculty. Missed assignments. Poor performance. The kid is circling the drain.

And Lina doesn't know what to do about it.

She's been teaching for twelve years. Won awards. Published. Students routinely tell her she changed their lives.

But Brian? She can't reach him. Every attempt—office hours, extensions, one-on-one check-ins—hits a wall of apathy.

And it's eating at her.

Because good teachers are supposed to reach every student, right? Supposed to find the key that unlocks their potential?

But what if there is no key? What if some students just... don't want to be taught?

After class, Brian is the first one out the door. Lina watches him go, feeling the familiar frustration rise.

*I'm failing him,* she thinks. *And I don't know how to stop.*

## The Limits of Teaching

We put teachers on impossible pedestals.

We expect them to inspire, educate, transform—to reach every student, regardless of aptitude, interest, or willingness.

And when they don't? When a student fails despite their best efforts? We blame the teacher.

*You didn't try hard enough. You didn't care enough. A good teacher would have found a way.*

But here's the truth we don't want to face:

You can't teach someone who doesn't want to learn.

Lina can provide information, structure, opportunity. She can make herself available, create engaging lessons, offer support.

But she can't make Brian care. She can't force him to do the work. She can't want his success more than he does.

And trying to do so—trying to carry the weight of his choices—will destroy her.

This is the teacher's paradox: Your duty is to teach. But learning is not your responsibility. It's theirs.

The Gītā understands this. Deeply.

Because Kṛṣṇa is a teacher. The greatest teacher. And even he can't force Arjuna to learn.

## The Gītā Speaks: The Gift, Not the Guarantee

The Bhagavad-gītā is a teaching. Seven hundred verses of wisdom. But it opens with a crisis:

Arjuna doesn't want to learn. He wants to escape.

"I will not fight," he declares. He throws down his weapons. He's done.

And Kṛṣṇa doesn't force him. Doesn't manipulate or coerce. Instead, he offers:

> ``Now hear, O son of Pṛthā, how by practicing yoga in full consciousness of Me, with mind attached to Me, you can know Me in full, free from doubt.''
>
> --- Bhagavad-gītā 7.1

"Hear." Not "you must." Not "I command you."

/Hear./

The teacher's duty is to offer the teaching. Clearly. Compassionately. Skillfully.

But whether the student receives it? That's not the teacher's to control.

And then Kṛṣṇa says something even more radical:

> ``Out of many thousands among men, one may endeavor for perfection, and of those who have achieved perfection, hardly one knows Me in truth.''
>
> --- Bhagavad-gītā 7.3

Read that again: Even among those who try, most don't succeed.

This isn't pessimism. It's honesty.

Not every student will get it. Not every mind is ready. Not every heart is open.

And that's not the teacher's failure. That's the nature of teaching.

Lina's duty is to show up, prepare well, teach clearly, and offer support. That's it.

Brian's duty is to engage, to do the work, to allow himself to be taught.

She can't do his part. And trying to will only burn her out.

## Living the Teaching: Offering Without Attachment

So what does Lina do?

Give up on Brian? Write him off? Stop trying?

No.

The Gītā doesn't teach apathy. It teaches detachment from results.

Here's the practice:

### Practice Box

**The Teacher's Dharma Practice**

**1. Clarify your actual duty.**
Your duty is to teach skillfully and make yourself available. Not to guarantee learning. Not to force transformation. Offer the gift. That's all you can do.

**2. Create the conditions for learning.**
Prepare well. Teach clearly. Be available. But don't confuse creating conditions with controlling outcomes.

**3. Release attachment to the student's response.**
Some will receive the teaching. Some won't. Some will years later. You can't control when or how it lands. Your job is to plant seeds, not to force them to grow.

**4. Maintain equanimity in success and failure.**
When students thrive, don't take all the credit. When they fail, don't take all the blame. You're a guide, not a god.

This is hard. Because teachers care. Deeply.

And caring makes us want to save every student. To reach the unreachable. To prove that love and effort can overcome anything.

But sometimes they can't.

And accepting that—without becoming cold or indifferent—is the teacher's liberation.

## The Way Forward: The Honest Conversation

Lina sends Brian an email: *Office hours this week. Need to see you. Not optional.*

He shows up. Late. Defensive.

"What's this about?"

Lina doesn't soften it. "You're failing. You know that, right?"

"Yeah. I know."

"Do you care?"

He shrugs. "I don't know. Not really."

"Then why are you here? In this class. In this program."

Another shrug. "My parents wanted me to go to college. Seemed easier than arguing."

Lina feels the familiar urge to fix this. To convince him he's wasting his potential. To inspire him to care.

But she stops herself.

"Brian," she says quietly. "I can't want your education more than you do."

He looks up, surprised.

"I can teach you. I can make the material available. I can answer questions, offer extensions, help you however you need. But I can't make you care. And I can't do the work for you."

Silence.

"So here's the choice: You can engage—actually engage—and I'll support you however I can. Or you can keep doing what you're doing and fail. But either way, the choice is yours. Not mine."

"So you're giving up on me?"

"No," Lina says. "I'm giving you responsibility for yourself. That's not giving up. That's respecting you enough to let you choose."

Brian leaves without committing to anything. And Lina doesn't chase him.

Two weeks later, he stops coming to class entirely.

Lina feels the sadness. The sense of loss. But not guilt.

Because she did her part. She taught. She offered. She made herself available.

Brian chose differently. And that's his right.

Three months later—after the semester ends—Lina gets an email:

*Professor Zhang,*

*I dropped out. I know you probably aren't surprised. I wanted to thank you, though. You were the only professor who told me the truth instead of trying to save me. It actually helped. I'm working now, figuring out what I actually want. Maybe I'll come back to school someday. Maybe not. But when I do, I'll be ready. Thanks for not bullshitting me.*

*—Brian*

Lina reads it twice.

She didn't save him. Didn't transform him. Didn't make him care.

But she did her duty. She taught. Honestly. Without attachment to his response.

And years from now—maybe—the seed she planted will grow.

Or maybe it won't.

Either way, she did what a teacher does: She offered the gift.

The rest was never hers to control.

## Reflection

- As a teacher (formal or informal), where are you trying to control whether others learn instead of focusing on teaching well? What attachment is driving that?
- Can you distinguish between your duty to offer the teaching and your attachment to the student's transformation? Where are you taking responsibility for things you can't control?
- What would it mean to teach with full effort and zero attachment to results? How would that change your relationship to the students who don't respond?
