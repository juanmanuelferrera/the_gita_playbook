# Chapter 23: Family

## The Sunday Call

Reena's phone buzzes at exactly 3:00 PM. Sunday. Like clockwork.

Mom calling.

She stares at the screen, debating. Answer and endure another hour of thinly veiled criticism? Or let it go to voicemail and deal with the guilt text tomorrow?

She answers.

"Hi, Mom."

"Reena! Finally. I've been waiting all week to hear from you."

Three days. It has been three days since they last spoke. But Reena does not correct her.

"How are you?"

"Oh, you know. Your father's knee is acting up again. And your brother still hasn't called -- can you believe it? Three weeks! But that's Arun. He only calls when he needs something."

Reena shifts her phone to the other ear, mentally preparing for the familiar script.

"And you? Still working those crazy hours?"

"I'm managing."

"You know, Mrs. Kapoor's daughter just got married. Beautiful wedding. They're saying she'll have her first baby by next year."

Here it comes.

"That's nice for them."

"You're thirty-five, Reena. When are you going to think about settling down?"

Reena closes her eyes. They have had this conversation seventeen times in the past year. Seventeen. She has counted.

"Mom, I'm focused on my career right now."

"Career, career. What good is a career if you have no one to share it with? You're wasting your best years --"

"I need to go. I have work to finish."

A pause. Then the wounded tone. "Always too busy for your own mother. Fine. Go."

Reena hangs up and sits in the silence of her apartment.

She loves her mother. She does. But every conversation leaves her feeling like she is failing an exam she did not sign up to take.

Not married. Not close enough. Not calling enough. Not enough.

And the guilt follows her everywhere.

## The Ties That Bind and Wound

Family.

We do not choose them. We are born into their patterns, their expectations, their wounds. And they shape us before we are old enough to understand we are being shaped.

The problem is not that we love them. Love is natural.

The problem is that love gets tangled with obligation, guilt, expectation, and duty in ways that strangle us.

You are supposed to call more. Visit more. Forgive instantly. Tolerate endlessly.

Because they are family.

And if you do not -- if you set boundaries, if you choose distance, if you prioritize your own well-being -- you are selfish. Ungrateful. A bad daughter.

Reena carries this weight constantly. Every decision she makes is shadowed by the question: What will my family think?

Not: What do I think?

And that is the cage.

The Gita understands this. Intimately. Because the entire teaching happens in the context of family. Arjuna stands on a battlefield, looking at uncles, cousins, teachers -- people he loves, people he is being asked to fight.

And he breaks.

## The Gita Speaks: Duty Beyond Blood

Arjuna's crisis is not abstract. It is visceral. It is family.

He cannot separate love from obligation, duty from attachment. And he says so directly:

> "Arjuna said: O killer of Madhu Krishna, how can I counterattack with arrows in battle men like Bhishma and Drona, who are worthy of my worship?"
>
> --- Bhagavad-gita 2.4

How can I act against the people I was raised to revere? How can I follow my duty when it means opposing the very people who shaped me?

This is Reena's question, translated from the battlefield to the Sunday phone call. How can I disappoint the woman who raised me? How can I set boundaries with someone I was taught to obey without question?

Arjuna calls Bhishma and Drona "worthy of my worship." Reena's mother is worthy of her respect, her love, her gratitude. That is not in question.

But worship does not mean obedience. Respect does not mean surrender of your own path.

And Krishna responds not by dismissing Arjuna's love for his family, but by revealing a deeper truth about who they actually are:

> "As the embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death. The self-realized soul is not bewildered by such a change."
>
> --- Bhagavad-gita 2.13

The people you call family are not just their roles. They are souls. Eternal. Beyond the temporary relationships of this life.

Your mother is not just your mother. She is a soul on her own journey -- a journey that began long before you and will continue long after. Your brother is not just your brother. He is an eternal being temporarily sharing this particular configuration of family.

And you are not just a daughter. You are a soul with your own path, your own purpose, your own duty that extends beyond family expectations.

This does not mean abandon them. It means stop confusing love with ownership. Stop letting guilt dictate your choices. Stop sacrificing your actual purpose to fulfill roles that were assigned, not chosen.

The self-realized soul is not bewildered by change -- not by the change of roles, not by the shift from child to adult, not by the evolution of a relationship from obedience to mutual respect.

Reena's mother wants her to stay the obedient daughter she raised. But Reena has passed from that stage, as inevitably as the soul passes from boyhood to youth. Bewilderment would mean pretending the change has not happened. Clarity means honoring it.

## Living the Teaching

So what does Reena do?

Cut off her family? Rebel? Burn bridges?

No. The Gita does not teach rejection. It teaches clarity.

### Practice Box

**The Family Dharma Practice**

1. **Distinguish love from obligation.** Ask yourself: Am I doing this because I genuinely want to support this person? Or because I feel guilty if I do not? Love acts freely. Obligation acts from fear. Arjuna's love for Bhishma was real -- but it was tangled with the obligation to submit. Untangle them.

2. **See the soul, not just the role.** Your mother is not only your mother. She is an eternal being with her own journey, her own unresolved longings, her own fears. When she pushes you toward marriage, she is not just being controlling -- she is expressing her own soul's concerns. See that, and compassion replaces resentment.

3. **Honor the passage.** The soul passes from boyhood to youth to old age. Relationships must pass too -- from child-parent obedience to adult-adult respect. Do not be bewildered by this change. It is natural. It is necessary.

4. **Accept that you cannot control their reaction.** Your mother may be hurt. Your father may be disappointed. You cannot fix that. You can only be true to your own path and trust that, as souls on their own journeys, they will find their way. As they must.

## The Way Forward

The next Sunday, Reena's phone buzzes at 3:00 PM.

She answers.

"Hi, Mom."

"Reena! I was just telling Mrs. Sharma about you. She asked if you're seeing anyone --"

"Mom," Reena interrupts, gently but firmly. "I need to talk to you about something."

A pause. "What's wrong?"

"Nothing's wrong. But I need you to understand something. I know you want me to get married. I know you think I'm wasting my life. But this is my life. And I'm living it the way that feels right to me."

Silence.

Then: "You think I don't want you to be happy?"

"I think you want me to be happy in a way that makes sense to you. But your path isn't mine, Mom. And that's okay."

"I'm your mother. I know what's best --"

"No," Reena says, and the word feels like freedom. "You know what was best for you. I need to discover what's best for me."

Her mother's voice cracks. "So I raised you just to have you reject everything I taught you?"

This is the moment.

Reena could crumble. Apologize. Take it back.

Or she could stand firm -- not from anger, but from the clarity that comes when you see both yourself and the person you love as souls on separate journeys.

"I'm not rejecting you," she says quietly. "I'm honoring myself. And I hope one day you can see that's not the same thing."

The call does not end well. Her mother is hurt. Angry. Reena knows it will be days, maybe weeks, before they speak again.

And the guilt is there. Familiar. Heavy.

But beneath it -- something new.

Peace.

Not because the relationship is fixed. It is not. Maybe it never will be.

But because Reena finally understood what Arjuna had to understand: the people you love are souls, worthy of your respect but not your submission. Your duty is your own. And following another's path -- even your family's path -- when it contradicts your own dharma is not love.

It is bewilderment.

And Reena is no longer bewildered.

## Reflection

- Where are you living according to your family's expectations rather than your own dharma? What would it cost to honor your own passage?
- Can you see the soul in your family members -- their own fears, their own journeys -- separate from the role they play in your life?
- What would it mean to love your family without being bewildered by the changes that growth demands?
