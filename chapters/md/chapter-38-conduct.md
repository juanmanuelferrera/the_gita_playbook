# Chapter 38: Conduct

## Opening Story

Maya finds the email by accident.

She's looking for a client file on her colleague Ben's computer--he asked her to grab it while he's out--and there it is. An email to their boss.

Subject line: "Concerns about the Rodriguez project."

She shouldn't read it. She knows she shouldn't.

But she does.

Ben has outlined every mistake Maya made on the project. Every missed deadline. Every communication breakdown. All framed as "concerns" but written with surgical precision to make her look incompetent.

The project launched successfully. The client is happy. But that's not what the email says.

Maya's hands shake.

Ben is her friend. They've worked together for three years. They've had drinks after work. He came to her wedding.

And he's been quietly undermining her for weeks.

When he gets back, she doesn't say anything. She grabs the file. Smiles. Walks away.

But inside, she's already drafting her response. She could forward the email to HR. She could confront him publicly in the next team meeting. She could write her own email to the boss, correcting every lie.

She could destroy him the way he tried to destroy her.

The question isn't whether she can. It's whether she should.

## Reflective Bridge

Conduct is easy when it doesn't cost you anything.

Being honest when no one's lying. Being fair when there's nothing to lose. Being kind when kindness is returned.

But real conduct--integrity--only shows up when you're tempted to abandon it.

Maya has every reason to strike back. Ben betrayed her trust. He lied about her work. He tried to damage her reputation.

She'd be justified in defending herself. In exposing him. In making sure he pays for what he did.

But justified doesn't mean right.

This is where conduct gets tested: when you've been wronged and you have the power to wrong back.

Maya's confusion mirrors a more ancient one. She doesn't know what to do--not because she lacks options, but because every option feels wrong. Retaliate, and she becomes what she despises. Stay silent, and injustice stands.

She's paralyzed. Not by weakness. By the weight of choosing who to be.

## The Gita Speaks: Clarity Through Principled Action

Arjuna faces a similar paralysis on the battlefield. Overwhelmed by the moral complexity of what lies before him, he admits:

> "Now I am confused about my duty and have lost all composure because of weakness."
>
> -- Bhagavad-gita 2.7

This is the honest starting point. Not bravado. Not certainty. Confusion. The willingness to say: I don't know what's right here.

But Krishna doesn't leave Arjuna in confusion. He gives him a framework for action that transcends the emotional chaos:

> "Fight to fight, regardless of happiness or sorrow, loss or gain, victory or defeat, and by doing this you will never incur sin."
>
> -- Bhagavad-gita 2.38

Regardless of happiness or sorrow. The instruction isn't "act when it feels good" or "act when you'll win." It's act from principle--and let the emotional weather be what it is.

Maya doesn't need to feel good about confronting Ben. She doesn't need to win. She needs to act with integrity, regardless of the outcome.

And that kind of action requires a singular focus:

> "Those who are on this path are very determined, and their goal is one."
>
> -- Bhagavad-gita 2.41

One goal. Not revenge. Not vindication. Not even fairness. The single aim of right conduct--action aligned with principle rather than reaction.

Krishna later describes what this looks like in a person's character:

> "One who is not envious but who is a kind friend to all living entities, who does not think himself a proprietor, who is free from false ego and equal both in happiness and distress, who is always satisfied and engaged in devotional service with determination and whose mind and intelligence are in agreement with Me--he is very dear to Me."
>
> -- Bhagavad-gita 12.13-14

A kind friend to all living entities. Even Ben. Not because Ben deserves kindness. Because Maya's conduct isn't determined by what others deserve. It's determined by who she is.

Free from false ego. The ego screams, "He disrespected you. Make him pay." But the person described here doesn't need to dominate. Doesn't need to win. They act from wholeness, not from wound.

## Living the Teaching

Maya doesn't send the retaliatory email.

Not because she's passive. Because she's strategic about who she wants to be.

### Practice Box

**1. Name the confusion honestly.** What are you tempted to do? What feels justified but violates your actual values? Admit the conflict clearly--like Arjuna admitting his confusion.

**2. Act from principle, not reaction.** Pause. Let the heat pass. Then choose: regardless of happiness or sorrow, loss or gain--what action aligns with your integrity?

**3. Make your goal singular.** Not revenge. Not vindication. Right conduct. One aim, clearly held.

**4. Be a kind friend--even to adversaries.** You can set boundaries, speak truth, and defend yourself without attacking, shaming, or retaliating. Address the situation, not the person.

Maya schedules a meeting with her boss. She doesn't mention Ben's email. She presents her own documentation: client feedback, project metrics, timeline records.

"I wanted to address some concerns that have apparently been raised about the Rodriguez project," she says calmly. "Here's the actual data."

Her boss reviews it. Nods. "This looks solid, Maya. Where are these concerns coming from?"

"I think there may have been some miscommunication," she says. "I wanted to make sure you had the complete picture."

She doesn't throw Ben under the bus. She doesn't need to. The data speaks.

Later, she talks to Ben directly. Not in anger. In clarity.

"I saw the email," she says. "I don't know why you felt the need to undermine me instead of coming to me directly. But I'm not interested in playing that game. If you have concerns about my work, talk to me. Otherwise, we keep this professional."

Ben stammers. Apologizes weakly. Offers excuses.

Maya doesn't engage. She's said what needed to be said.

Her integrity is intact.

## The Way Forward

Six months later, Ben is transferred to a different team. Maya doesn't ask for details.

But her boss pulls her aside. "I want you to know--I see how you handle conflict. A lot of people would have made that situation ugly. You kept it professional."

Maya nods. "I try to focus on the work."

"It's more than that," her boss says. "It's character."

Maya doesn't tell her about the drafts she wrote. The angry emails she never sent. The revenge fantasies she entertained.

Because what matters isn't what you're tempted to do. It's what you actually do.

And what she actually did was find clarity through confusion--the same journey Arjuna made. At the end of the Gita, after receiving Krishna's full teaching, Arjuna declares:

> "Arjuna said: My dear Krishna, O You Infallible, now my illusion has dissipated. By Your mercy I have recovered my memory. Now I am firm and free from doubts, and I am willing to act in accordance with Your instructions."
>
> -- Bhagavad-gita 18.73

Illusion dissipated. Memory recovered. Firm and free from doubt.

Maya started confused. She ended clear. Not because the situation changed. Because she did.

Conduct isn't about being perfect. It's about being principled. Even when it costs you something. Even when no one's watching. Even when you've been wronged.

Because in the end, the person you have to live with is yourself. And you can't build a life of integrity on a foundation of compromised conduct--no matter how justified the compromise felt in the moment.

## Reflection

- When have you been confused about duty--genuinely unsure of the right action? Did you act from principle or from reaction?
- What would it mean to act regardless of happiness or sorrow, loss or gain? Can you hold one singular aim when the temptation is to fracture into revenge, fear, or self-pity?
- What illusion needs to dissipate before you can act with clarity? What would it take to say, like Arjuna, "I am firm and free from doubts"?
