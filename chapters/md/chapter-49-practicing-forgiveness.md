# Chapter 49: Practicing Forgiveness

## The Letter

Dear Dad,

I'm writing this letter I'll never send.

The therapist says I should. Says it might help me process. Let go. Move on.

You died three years ago. Liver failure. All those years of drinking finally caught up.

I didn't cry at your funeral. Everyone thought I was strong. Stoic. Holding it together for Mom.

But really, I was just... numb. Maybe relieved. Is that terrible to admit?

You weren't a monster. You never hit us. You worked. You provided. But you were absent. Checked out. Even when you were physically there, you weren't really there.

And when I needed you—really needed you—you had nothing to give.

Graduation. You were drunk.

Wedding. You left early.

When Maya was born. You visited once. Held her for five minutes. Left.

I told myself it didn't matter. That I didn't need you. That I was fine.

But I'm not fine, Dad.

I'm angry. Still. After all this time.

And I don't know how to let it go.

—David

## The Weight of Unforgiveness

David folds the letter. Puts it in his desk drawer with the other twelve he's written.

None of them sent. All of them the same.

Anger. Hurt. Accusation. Longing for what never was.

His wife asks, "Did writing help?"

"No," he says. "It just reminds me he's gone. And I never got the chance to tell him how much he hurt me. Or hear him apologize."

"Would you have wanted to hear it?"

David pauses. "I don't know. Maybe. Maybe I just wanted him to see me. Really see me. Acknowledge what he did. What he failed to do."

But that's never happening now.

His father is dead. The possibility of reconciliation, of closure, of resolution—gone.

And David is left holding this anger with nowhere to put it.

Forgiveness, everyone says. You need to forgive him. For your own peace.

But how do you forgive someone who never asked for forgiveness? Who never even acknowledged the harm? Who died without giving you the closure you needed?

How do you forgive when every cell in your body screams that what happened wasn't okay?

The therapist says forgiveness isn't about condoning. It's about releasing.

But David doesn't know how to release what feels surgically attached to his identity.

He's "the son whose father disappointed him." He's built a life around being nothing like his dad. Proving he's different. Better. Present.

If he forgives, who is he?

If he lets go of the anger, what's left?

## The Gītā Speaks: Liberation Through Release

The Bhagavad-gītā doesn't say forgiveness is easy.

It says it's necessary. For your own freedom.

> ``One who is not envious but is a kind friend to all living entities, who does not think himself a proprietor and is free from false ego, who is equal in both happiness and distress, who is tolerant, always satisfied, self-controlled, and engaged in devotional service with determination, his mind and intelligence fixed on Me—such a devotee of Mine is very dear to Me.''
>
> --- Bhagavad-gītā 12.13-14

**A kind friend to all living entities.** Not just to those who deserve it. To all. Including those who've harmed you.

**Free from false ego.** The ego holds grudges. Keeps score. Demands justice. The liberated self releases.

**Equal in both happiness and distress, tolerant.** This doesn't mean passive. It means not imprisoned by others' actions.

Later, Kṛṣṇa addresses the poisonous nature of holding on:

> ``There are three gates leading to this hell—lust, anger, and greed. Every sane man should give these up, for they lead to the degradation of the soul.''
>
> --- Bhagavad-gītā 16.21

**Anger leads to hell.** Not metaphorical hell. The internal hell of being consumed by resentment.

**Degradation of the soul.** Unforgiveness doesn't hurt the person you refuse to forgive. It degrades you.

David's father is beyond harm now. He's dead. The anger can't touch him.

But it's destroying David. Day by day. Thought by thought.

Forgiveness isn't for his father. It's for David.

It's the choice to stop drinking poison and expecting someone else to die.

## Living the Teaching: The Practice of Letting Go

David sits with his wife one evening.

"I don't know how to forgive him," he says.

"Maybe start with understanding," she suggests. "Not excusing. Understanding."

David resists. But then asks: "Understanding what?"

"What made him the way he was. What pain was he carrying that he couldn't show up for you?"

David thinks. His father's own father died when he was ten. Raised by a harsh stepfather. Joined the military at eighteen. Saw combat. Came back different.

"He was broken," David says quietly. "Wasn't he?"

"Maybe," his wife says. "Broken people break things. Including their children. But understanding that doesn't mean what he did was okay. It just means... he was human. Flawed. Limited."

David feels something crack in his chest.

His father wasn't a villain. He was a wounded man who never healed. Who passed his wounds to his son because he didn't know how to do otherwise.

That doesn't make it okay. But it makes it comprehensible.

Human.

### Practice Box

**The Practice of Forgiveness**

**1. Acknowledge the harm.** Don't minimize. Don't excuse. What happened hurt. It was wrong. That's valid.

**2. Understand the human.** Not to excuse, but to see clearly. What pain were they carrying? What wounds shaped their actions? They're not evil—they're broken.

**3. Release the demand for justice.** You won't get the apology. The acknowledgment. The closure. Demanding it keeps you prisoner. Let it go.

**4. Choose freedom over fairness.** Forgiveness isn't fair. They don't deserve it. But you deserve peace. Choose your liberation over their punishment.

**5. Forgive in stages.** You won't do it once. You'll choose it again and again. Each time the anger resurfaces, choose release. Again. And again.

David writes one more letter. Different from the others.

Dear Dad,

I'm angry. I probably always will be, in some way. You hurt me. Left me. Failed me in ways that shaped my whole life.

But I'm choosing to let you go.

Not because you deserve forgiveness. Because I deserve freedom.

I release my demand that you were different. That you were present. That you were whole.

You were wounded. And you wounded me. And I don't want to carry your wounds anymore.

I forgive you. Not all at once. Not perfectly. But I'm starting.

I hope you found peace. I hope wherever you are, you're free of whatever pain drove you to check out.

And I hope I can be free too.

—David

He reads it. Cries. Folds it.

This one, he burns. Watches it turn to ash.

A ritual. A release. A letting go.

## The Way Forward: Freedom in Forgiveness

A year later, David visits his father's grave.

First time since the funeral.

He stands there. Says nothing. Feels nothing dramatic.

Just... quiet.

The anger is still there sometimes. Smaller. Less consuming.

But mostly, there's space. Room to breathe. Freedom.

His daughter asks, "Did Grandpa love you?"

David pauses. Thinks. Answers honestly: "I think he loved me the only way he knew how. Which wasn't enough. But it was all he had."

"Are you mad at him?"

"Not anymore," David says. "Not like I was. I understand him now. And I've let him go."

"Does that mean you forgive him?"

David nods. "Yeah. I think it does."

Because forgiveness isn't a feeling. It's a choice.

It's choosing freedom over resentment. Peace over punishment. Your liberation over their debt.

It doesn't erase the past. Doesn't make the harm okay. Doesn't mean you forget or trust blindly.

It means you stop letting their actions define your present.

You release them. You release yourself.

And you walk forward, lighter, freer, whole.

Not because they earned it. Because you chose it.

That's forgiveness.

And it's the most powerful thing you can do.

Not for them. For you.

## Reflection

- Who are you refusing to forgive? What are you demanding from them that you'll never receive? What's that refusal costing you?
- Can you understand without excusing? Can you see their humanity—their wounds, their limitations—without making what they did okay?
- What would freedom feel like? If you released your demand for justice, for apology, for closure—who would you become? Are you brave enough to choose that?
