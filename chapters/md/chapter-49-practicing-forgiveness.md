# Chapter 49: Practicing Forgiveness

## Opening Story

Dear Dad,

I'm writing this letter I'll never send.

The therapist says I should. Says it might help me process. Let go. Move on.

You died three years ago. Liver failure. All those years of drinking finally caught up.

I didn't cry at your funeral. Everyone thought I was strong. Stoic. Holding it together for Mom.

But really, I was just numb. Maybe relieved. Is that terrible to admit?

You weren't a monster. You never hit us. You worked. You provided. But you were absent. Checked out. Even when you were physically there, you weren't really there.

Graduation. You were drunk. Wedding. You left early. When Maya was born, you visited once. Held her for five minutes. Left.

I told myself it didn't matter. That I didn't need you. That I was fine.

But I'm not fine, Dad. I'm angry. Still. After all this time.

And I don't know how to let it go.

--David

## Reflective Bridge

David folds the letter. Puts it in his desk drawer with the other twelve he's written.

None of them sent. All of them the same. Anger. Hurt. Accusation. Longing for what never was.

His wife asks, "Did writing help?"

"No," he says. "It just reminds me he's gone. And I never got the chance to tell him how much he hurt me. Or hear him apologize."

"Would you have wanted to hear it?"

David pauses. "I don't know. Maybe I just wanted him to see me. Really see me. Acknowledge what he did. What he failed to do."

But that's never happening now. His father is dead. The possibility of reconciliation, of closure, of resolution--gone. And David is left holding this anger with nowhere to put it.

Forgiveness, everyone says. You need to forgive him. For your own peace.

But how do you forgive someone who never asked for forgiveness? Who never even acknowledged the harm? Who died without giving you the closure you needed?

The therapist says forgiveness isn't about condoning. It's about releasing. But David doesn't know how to release what feels surgically attached to his identity.

He's "the son whose father disappointed him." He's built a life around being nothing like his dad. If he forgives, who is he? If he lets go of the anger, what's left?

## The Gita Speaks: Liberation Through Release

The Bhagavad-gita doesn't say forgiveness is easy. It says it's necessary. For your own freedom.

Consider Arjuna's prayer to the Supreme Lord--a moment of raw vulnerability after witnessing the universal form:

> "You are the Supreme Lord, to be worshiped by every living being. Thus I fall down to offer You my respects and ask Your mercy. Please tolerate the wrongs that I may have done to You and bear with me as a father with his son, or a friend with his friend, or a lover with his beloved."
>
> -- Bhagavad-gita 11.44

**Bear with me as a father with his son.** Even Arjuna, standing before the Supreme, asks for the kind of forgiveness a father extends to a child. The metaphor cuts both ways. A father bears with a son's mistakes--not because the son deserves it, but because love endures beyond offense. David's father couldn't offer that. But David can choose to extend that same grace in reverse--bearing with a flawed father, not because the father earned it, but because holding on is its own imprisonment.

**Please tolerate the wrongs I may have done.** Arjuna doesn't minimize his offenses. He names them and asks for mercy anyway. Forgiveness begins with honesty--acknowledging what happened without pretending it didn't matter.

Then Krishna describes the qualities of one who is truly free:

> "One who is not envious but who is a kind friend to all living entities, who does not think himself a proprietor, who is free from false ego and equal both in happiness and distress, who is always satisfied and engaged in devotional service with determination and whose mind and intelligence are in agreement with Me--he is very dear to Me."
>
> -- Bhagavad-gita 12.13-14

**A kind friend to all living entities.** Not just to those who deserve it. To all. Including those who've harmed you.

**Free from false ego.** The ego holds grudges. Keeps score. Demands justice. The liberated self releases.

**Equal both in happiness and distress.** This doesn't mean passive. It means not imprisoned by others' actions.

And in His description of divine qualities, Krishna names forgiveness directly:

> "The Blessed Lord said: Fearlessness, purification of one's existence, cultivation of spiritual knowledge, charity, self-control, performance of sacrifice, study of the Vedas, austerity and simplicity; nonviolence, truthfulness, freedom from anger; renunciation, tranquility, aversion to fault finding, compassion and freedom from covetousness; gentleness, modesty and steady determination; vigor, forgiveness, fortitude, cleanliness, freedom from envy and the passion for honor--these transcendental qualities, O son of Bharata, belong to godly men endowed with divine nature."
>
> -- Bhagavad-gita 16.1-3

**Freedom from anger. Forgiveness. Aversion to fault finding.** These are not weaknesses. They are transcendental qualities--the mark of a divine nature. Krishna places forgiveness alongside fearlessness and fortitude. It takes strength to release a grudge. Courage to stop keeping score.

David's anger isn't protecting him. It's degrading what is most noble in him.

Forgiveness isn't for his father. It's for David. It's the choice to stop drinking poison and expecting someone else to die.

## Living the Teaching

David sits with his wife one evening.

"I don't know how to forgive him," he says.

"Maybe start with understanding," she suggests. "Not excusing. Understanding."

David resists. But then asks: "Understanding what?"

"What made him the way he was. What pain was he carrying that he couldn't show up for you?"

David thinks. His father's own father died when he was ten. Raised by a harsh stepfather. Joined the military at eighteen. Saw combat. Came back different.

"He was broken," David says quietly. "Wasn't he?"

"Maybe," his wife says. "Broken people break things. Including their children. But understanding that doesn't mean what he did was okay. It just means he was human. Flawed. Limited."

David feels something crack in his chest. His father wasn't a villain. He was a wounded man who never healed. Who passed his wounds to his son because he didn't know how to do otherwise.

That doesn't make it okay. But it makes it comprehensible. Human.

### Practice Box

**The Practice of Forgiveness**

**1. Acknowledge the harm honestly.** Don't minimize. Don't excuse. What happened hurt. It was wrong. That's valid. Like Arjuna before the universal form, name the offense before asking for grace.

**2. Understand the human behind the harm.** Not to excuse, but to see clearly. What pain were they carrying? What wounds shaped their actions? They're not evil--they're broken.

**3. Release the demand for justice.** You won't get the apology. The acknowledgment. The closure. Demanding it keeps you prisoner. Let it go.

**4. Choose divine qualities over ego.** Forgiveness, freedom from anger, aversion to fault finding--these are not passive surrender. They are the qualities Krishna calls transcendental. Choose them as acts of strength.

## The Way Forward

David writes one more letter. Different from the others.

Dear Dad,

I'm angry. I probably always will be, in some way. You hurt me. Left me. Failed me in ways that shaped my whole life.

But I'm choosing to let you go. Not because you deserve forgiveness. Because I deserve freedom.

You were wounded. And you wounded me. And I don't want to carry your wounds anymore.

I forgive you. Not all at once. Not perfectly. But I'm starting.

--David

He reads it. Cries. Folds it. This one, he burns. Watches it turn to ash. A ritual. A release.

A year later, David visits his father's grave. First time since the funeral. He stands there. Says nothing. The anger is still there sometimes. Smaller. Less consuming. But mostly, there's space. Room to breathe.

His daughter Maya asks, "Did Grandpa love you?"

David pauses. "I think he loved me the only way he knew how. Which wasn't enough. But it was all he had."

"Are you mad at him?"

"Not anymore. Not like I was. I understand him now. And I've let him go."

Because forgiveness isn't a feeling. It's a choice. It's choosing freedom over resentment. Peace over punishment. Divine nature over wounded ego.

It doesn't erase the past. Doesn't make the harm okay.

It means you stop letting their actions define your present. You release them. You release yourself.

## Reflection

- Who are you refusing to forgive? What are you demanding from them that you'll never receive? What's that refusal costing you?
- Can you understand without excusing? Can you see their humanity--their wounds, their limitations--without making what they did okay?
- Which divine qualities from Krishna's list do you most need to cultivate? Freedom from anger? Aversion to fault finding? Forgiveness itself? What would it look like to practice one of them today?
