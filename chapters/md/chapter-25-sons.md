# Chapter 25: Sons

## The Man He's Becoming

Robert watches his son pack for college from the doorway.

Eighteen years. Gone in a blink.

Ethan moves efficiently, methodically. Clothes folded. Books stacked. The posters coming down from walls that have held them since middle school.

Robert wants to say something. Something meaningful. Fatherly. The kind of thing Ethan will remember years from now.

But the words won't come.

Because what he's really feeling -- beneath the pride, beneath the excitement for his son's future -- is grief.

Ethan doesn't need him anymore. Not in the way he used to. No more help with homework. No more basketball in the driveway. No more late-night talks about school drama.

His son is leaving. Becoming his own person. And Robert is terrified he did it wrong.

"You need help with anything?" Robert finally asks.

Ethan glances up. "I'm good, Dad. Thanks."

"Okay. Let me know if you change your mind."

Robert retreats to his study. Sits in the chair where he used to hold Ethan as a baby. Where they read bedtime stories. Where he taught him to tie his shoes.

He thinks about all the moments he wasn't there. The business trips. The late nights at the office. The times he chose work over the school play, the soccer game, the simple request to just hang out.

He told himself he was providing. Building a future. Giving Ethan opportunities.

But now, watching his son prepare to leave, Robert wonders: Did I give him me?

Or did I give him everything except what mattered most?

## Raising Boys to Men

Fathers and sons carry a particular weight.

Society tells boys: Don't cry. Be strong. Provide. Protect. Become a man.

And fathers -- especially fathers who were raised the same way -- often don't know how to give their sons what they never received themselves: Permission to be human. Vulnerable. Uncertain.

Robert raised Ethan the way he was raised: Fix problems. Be tough. Don't show weakness.

And Ethan learned. Learned to hide his struggles. Learned to handle things alone. Learned that asking for help was failure.

He learned to be independent. Self-sufficient. Strong.

But did he learn he was loved? Not for what he achieved, but for who he is?

Robert doesn't know. And the not knowing terrifies him.

Because he can't redo those years. Can't go back and be more present. Can't rewrite the moments he prioritized work over connection.

The Gita speaks to this -- not about parenting specifically, but about fatherhood, equality, and the painful wisdom of letting go.

## The Gita Speaks: The Father of All

When Arjuna stands on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, he faces the ultimate crisis of relationship. Family on both sides. Teachers. Friends. Sons.

And in the middle of that crisis, Krishna reveals something about the nature of fatherhood itself:

> "I am the father of this universe, the mother, the support, and the grandsire."
>
> -- Bhagavad-gita 9.17

The Supreme Lord claims fatherhood -- not as ownership, but as origin. The father who gives life does not thereby own the life he gives. He supports. He sustains. But the soul he brought into the world walks its own path.

Robert feels the weight of this. He wants to hold on. Wants to shape Ethan into someone specific. But fatherhood, at its deepest, is an act of giving -- not possessing.

And then Krishna speaks about what real wisdom looks like in the life of a householder:

> "The perception of the evil of birth, death, old age and disease; nonattachment to children, wife, home and the rest, and evenmindedness amid pleasant and unpleasant events."
>
> -- Bhagavad-gita 13.9

Nonattachment to children. Not indifference -- nonattachment. The distinction matters.

Indifference says: I don't care what happens to you.

Nonattachment says: I love you completely, but I will not make your life about my needs. I will not cling to who you were or demand you become who I want. I will let you be.

This is the hardest practice a father will ever face. Because every instinct screams: Hold on. Protect. Control.

But the Gita says: Release. Trust. Let the soul walk.

And there is this -- the recognition that love, at its highest, sees no division:

> "He is a perfect yogi who, by comparison to his own self, sees the true equality of all beings, both in their happiness and distress, O Arjuna!"
>
> -- Bhagavad-gita 6.32

Robert's pain is Ethan's pain. Ethan's joy is Robert's joy. Not because they share blood -- but because the soul in one is no different from the soul in the other. A father who grasps this stops trying to mold his son and starts trying to see him.

## Living the Teaching

So what does Robert do?

Pretend everything's fine? Tell himself Ethan turned out great so it all worked out? Let the moment pass without saying what matters?

No.

### Practice Box

**The Father-Son Truth Practice**

**1. Acknowledge what you missed.**
Don't defend your choices. Don't justify. Just admit: "I wasn't there as much as I should have been. I prioritized the wrong things sometimes."

**2. See the soul, not the projection.**
Your son is not your second chance. Not your legacy. Not a reflection of your success or failure. He is an eternal being with his own path. Can you see him -- actually see him -- without the filter of what you wanted him to be?

**3. Give him permission to be human.**
Tell him: "You don't have to have it all figured out. You don't have to be strong all the time. It's okay to struggle." Break the cycle of stoic silence.

**4. Release control of who he becomes.**
Your job was to guide him this far. Now it's his path. Trust that -- even with your mistakes -- you gave him what he needed to walk it.

## The Way Forward

The night before Ethan leaves, Robert knocks on his door.

"Got a minute?"

Ethan looks up from his laptop. "Sure."

Robert sits on the edge of the bed. Feels the weight of eighteen years pressing on this moment.

"I want to say something before you go tomorrow."

Ethan waits.

"I wasn't there as much as I should have been. Growing up, I mean. I told myself I was working hard to give you opportunities. And I was. But I also used work as an excuse to avoid... being present. Really present."

Ethan shifts uncomfortably. "Dad, you don't have to --"

"Let me finish." Robert's voice cracks slightly. "I'm proud of the man you're becoming. You're kind. Thoughtful. Braver than I was at your age. And I want you to know something: You don't have to be perfect. You don't have to have everything figured out. And you don't have to do it all alone."

Silence.

Then Ethan says quietly, "I never felt like you weren't there."

"Really?"

"I mean, yeah, you worked a lot. But you showed up to the stuff that mattered. And when I needed you, you were there. Even if I didn't always say I needed you."

Robert feels tears threatening. "I worried I'd messed it all up."

"You didn't." Ethan hesitates. "Can I ask you something?"

"Anything."

"Did you ever feel like you didn't know what you were doing? As a dad?"

Robert laughs -- broken, relieved. "Every single day."

"Really?"

"Being a parent means stumbling through, hoping you're not screwing it up too badly. I'm still figuring it out."

Ethan nods. "That actually helps. Knowing you don't have it all figured out."

"Why?"

"Because I don't either. And I was worried that was a problem."

Robert reaches over, squeezes his son's shoulder. "It's not a problem. It's being human."

They sit in comfortable silence. Not solving anything. Just... present.

The next morning, Robert helps load the car. Hugs his son longer than usual.

"Call if you need anything," he says.

"I will."

"I mean it. Even just to talk. About nothing. Anything."

Ethan smiles. "I know, Dad. I will."

And as Robert watches his son drive away, he feels it: The grief. The pride. The uncertainty.

But also peace.

Because he did his duty. Not perfectly. Not the way he imagined.

But honestly. Presently. As himself.

And that -- the Gita teaches -- is all any father can do.

The rest is his son's path. And Robert has to trust it.

## Reflection

- If you're a father, what did you prioritize in raising your son? Was it your actual duty, or society's definition? What would change if you focused on presence over perfection?
- What did your father give you -- or fail to give you? Can you offer your son (or the young men in your life) what you wish you'd received?
- Are you trying to control who your son becomes, or trusting him to find his own path? What would it mean to release that control while still offering guidance?
