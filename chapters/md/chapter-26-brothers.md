# Chapter 26: Brothers

## The Old Rivalry

Marcus and David haven't spoken in two years.

Not because of a fight. Not because of some dramatic falling-out. Just... drift. The slow accumulation of unanswered calls, missed birthdays, resentments never addressed.

Brothers. Separated by three years in age and a lifetime of comparison.

Marcus was always the golden child. Straight A's. Full scholarship. Law degree. Partner at thirty-five. The son their parents bragged about.

David was the other one. Creative. Unfocused. Dropout. Freelance graphic designer making just enough to get by. The son their parents worried about.

And now their father is dying.

The call came from their mother: "You need to come home. Both of you. He doesn't have much time."

So here they are. Sitting in the hospital waiting room. Twenty feet apart. Not speaking.

Marcus scrolls through his phone. David stares at the wall.

The silence feels like concrete.

Their mother emerges from the room, eyes red. "He wants to see you. Together."

They stand. Walk to the door. Still not speaking.

Inside, their father looks smaller than Marcus remembers. Pale. Fragile. The machines beeping softly.

"My boys," he says weakly. "Come here."

They approach the bed. Stand on opposite sides.

"I don't have long," their father says. "So I'm going to say this once. Whatever happened between you two—fix it. Life's too short for this."

Marcus feels the familiar defensiveness rising. *I'm not the one who stopped calling. I'm not the one who refused help. I'm not—*

But their father interrupts the thought. "Marcus. David. You're brothers. That means something."

Does it? Marcus wonders. Because right now, standing here, David feels like a stranger.

## Sibling Rivalry in Adulthood

We think sibling rivalry ends with childhood.

The competition for parental attention. The fights over toys. The jealousy over who got more.

But it doesn't end. It just gets quieter. More sophisticated. More painful.

Because as adults, we're still comparing. Still measuring. Still asking the question we asked as children: *Am I enough? Am I the favorite? Am I loved?*

Marcus measures himself against David and feels superior. Successful. The responsible one.

But beneath that? Resentment. Because David got to be the artist. The free spirit. The one who didn't carry the weight of family expectations.

David measures himself against Marcus and feels inadequate. The failure. The disappointment.

But beneath that? Envy. Because Marcus got the approval. The pride. The validation that David craved but never received.

They're both trapped. In comparison. In old roles assigned decades ago. In the belief that love is a competition and only one brother can win.

The Gītā speaks to this—not about siblings specifically, but about the illusion of separation.

## The Gītā Speaks: Beyond False Divisions

The entire Bhagavad-gītā takes place because of a rivalry between cousins.

The Pāṇḍavas and the Kauravas. Brothers by blood. Enemies by choice.

And Arjuna—standing between them—represents the pain of that division. The agony of family turned against family.

"How can I fight my own kinsmen?" he asks Kṛṣṇa.

And Kṛṣṇa's answer cuts through the illusion:

> ``For the soul there is never birth nor death. Nor, having once been, does he ever cease to be. He is unborn, eternal, ever-existing, undying and primordial.''
>
> --- Bhagavad-gītā 2.20

What does this have to do with Marcus and David?

Everything.

Kṛṣṇa is saying: The roles you're playing—successful brother, struggling brother—are temporary. Illusions. The eternal soul within each of you is beyond comparison, beyond competition, beyond the stories your family told about who you're supposed to be.

Marcus isn't "the successful one." David isn't "the creative one." Those are masks. Roles. And clinging to them keeps you separated.

The truth? You're souls. Brothers. Connected at a level deeper than achievement or approval.

And then Kṛṣṇa says this:

> ``One who is not envious but who is a kind friend to all living entities, who does not think himself a proprietor, who is free from false ego and equal both in happiness and distress, who is always satisfied... such a person is very dear to Me.''
>
> --- Bhagavad-gītā 12.13-14

"Not envious." "Free from false ego."

That's the path out. Not through winning the rivalry. But through releasing it.

## Living the Teaching: Releasing the Roles

So what do Marcus and David do?

Pretend the rift doesn't exist? Force a reconciliation neither of them feels ready for? Go back to silence?

No.

The Gītā doesn't teach fake harmony. It teaches honest recognition.

Here's the practice:

### Practice Box

**The Brother Reconciliation Practice**

**1. Name the old story honestly.**
What role did you play? What role did they play? Not to blame, but to see clearly: ``I was cast as the successful one. You were cast as the struggling one. And we both suffered from those roles.''

**2. Acknowledge the pain—yours and theirs.**
You both carry wounds. You both missed out. You both lost something in the comparison. Can you see that without defending your position?

**3. Release the need to win.**
There's no prize for being the better brother. No victory in proving your worth. The competition was always an illusion. Can you let it go?

**4. See the soul, not the story.**
Your brother isn't his successes or failures. He's an eternal being, walking his own path. Can you honor that without needing him to be different?

This is hard. Because the roles feel real. The wounds are real. The years of separation created distance that can't be bridged in a moment.

But the Gītā teaches: Start with recognition. See the truth. The rest will follow.

## The Way Forward: The Conversation

After their father falls asleep, Marcus and David sit in the hospital cafeteria. Coffee in Styrofoam cups. Still not speaking.

Finally, Marcus breaks. "I don't know how to talk to you anymore."

David looks up, surprised. "What?"

"We used to be close. When we were kids. And then... somewhere along the way, I became the responsible one and you became the screwup. And I don't know how that happened."

"I'm not a screwup."

"I know. But that's how Mom and Dad talked about you. And I... I went along with it. Made myself feel better by thinking I was the successful one."

David is quiet for a moment. Then: "You were successful."

"Maybe. But I resented you for it."

"For being successful?"

"For being free. You got to do what you wanted. Follow your passion. I had to be the one who did everything right. Carried all the expectations."

David laughs—bitter. "You think I was free? I spent my entire life trying to get Dad to look at me the way he looked at you. And I never could. No matter what I did."

Marcus feels something crack open. "I didn't know that."

"How could you? We stopped talking about real things years ago. Just... surface stuff. Holidays. Birthdays. Nothing true."

"I'm sorry."

"For what?"

"For competing with you. For making you feel like you weren't enough. For believing the story that there was only room for one of us to be the favorite."

David's eyes well up. "I did the same thing. Made you the enemy so I didn't have to face my own stuff."

They sit in silence. Not the concrete silence from before. Something softer. More real.

"I don't know if we can fix this," Marcus says. "Two years is a long time."

"We don't have to fix it all at once. Maybe we just... start talking. Honestly. No more performing."

Marcus nods. "I'd like that."

"Me too."

Their father dies three days later. Marcus and David sit together at the funeral. Not separated. Not performing the old roles.

Just brothers. Grieving. Beginning.

It's not resolved. There are still wounds. Still patterns to break.

But the competition is over. Because they finally saw the truth:

Love was never a limited resource. There was always enough for both of them.

They just had to stop fighting over it and start receiving it.

## Reflection

- What role did you play in your family? What role did your sibling(s) play? How have those roles trapped you both?
- Where are you still competing with your brother or sister—for validation, for success, for being "the good one"? What would it mean to release that competition?
- Can you see your sibling as a soul on their own path rather than as a character in your story? What becomes possible when you stop needing them to be different?
