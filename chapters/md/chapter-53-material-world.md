# Chapter 53: Material World

## Then

2015: The apartment is everything.

Three thousand square feet. Floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the city. Italian marble in the bathroom. A kitchen Raj never uses.

He bought it cash. Bonus from the Goldman deal.

Standing in the empty space the day he got the keys, he felt it: arrival. Success. Proof.

*I made it.*

The apartment said things Raj couldn't say himself. To his parents who'd worked double shifts so he could go to college. To the kids who'd mocked his accent in middle school. To the part of himself that still felt like the immigrant kid who didn't belong.

*See? I'm somebody now.*

He fills it carefully. Eames chair. Restoration Hardware couch. Abstract art he doesn't understand but knows is expensive.

Each piece another brick in the wall between who he was and who he's become.

The apartment is featured in /Architectural Digest/. His mother sends copies to relatives in India.

Raj frames the magazine cover.

## Now

2025: The apartment is just a place.

Same floor-to-ceiling windows. Same Italian marble. Same expensive furniture.

But Raj sees it differently now.

Not because the apartment changed.

Because he did.

## The Shift

What happened between then and now wasn't dramatic.

No crisis. No loss. No spiritual awakening in an ashram.

Just... accumulation.

The apartment led to the vacation home in the Hamptons. Which led to the vintage car collection. Which led to the art investments. Which led to the watch collection.

Each acquisition promised fulfillment.

Each delivered briefly.

Then the hunger returned. Sharper.

Raj remembers the moment he knew something was wrong.

Standing in his walk-in closet—a room bigger than his childhood bedroom—unable to decide which of forty custom suits to wear.

And feeling... empty.

Not sad. Not depressed.

Empty.

Like he'd been filling a vessel with a hole in the bottom.

"You have everything," his brother said during their last visit.

Raj heard what his brother didn't say: /And you're still not happy./

That's when he started asking the question.

Not out loud. Not to anyone.

Just to himself, late at night, sitting in the Eames chair that cost more than his father's annual salary:

*What's all this for?*

## The Gītā Speaks: Using Without Clinging

The Bhagavad-gītā doesn't condemn material things.

It condemns what we do with them. What we make them mean. What we let them make us believe.

Kṛṣṇa tells Arjuna:

> ``A person who is not disturbed by the incessant flow of desires—that enter like rivers into the ocean, which is ever being filled but is always still—can alone achieve peace, and not the person who strives to satisfy such desires.''
>
> --- Bhagavad-gītā 2.70

Read that again.

The ocean is "ever being filled but is always still."

The problem isn't the rivers entering. It's trying to be satisfied by them.

The material world flows into your life. Objects. Experiences. Achievements. Possessions.

That's not the issue.

The issue is believing they'll finally complete you.

Later, Kṛṣṇa makes it even clearer:

> ``One who is not attached to the fruits of his work and who works as he is obligated is in the renounced order of life, and he is the true mystic, not he who lights no fire and performs no duty.''
>
> --- Bhagavad-gītā 6.1

This is radical.

The person who works without attachment to results—who earns money, buys things, builds a life, but doesn't cling to the outcomes—*that* person is truly renounced.

Not the one who runs away to a cave.

You can live in a three-thousand-square-foot apartment and be free.

You can own nothing and be imprisoned.

Freedom isn't about what you have.

It's about what has you.

## Living the Teaching: In the World, Not of It

Raj doesn't sell the apartment.

That would be running away. Reacting. Making material renunciation another form of materialism.

Instead, he changes his relationship to it.

The apartment becomes a tool, not an identity.

A comfortable place to live. A space to host his aging parents when they visit. A home base for work.

But not proof of arrival.

Not a statement to the world.

Not the thing that makes him somebody.

He stops the acquisitions. Not from deprivation. From clarity.

The vacation home goes up for sale. Not because ownership is bad. But because maintaining it created stress, not peace.

The car collection gets donated. Not because cars are evil. But because he realized he kept them to impress people he didn't even like.

What remains is what serves.

And Raj feels lighter.

Not because he has less.

Because less has him.

### Practice Box

**The Practice of Right Relationship with Material Things**

\begin{enumerate}
\item **Name what you're trying to prove.** Look at your possessions honestly. What are you trying to prove with them? Success? Worth? Belonging? Intelligence? Taste? Write it down. Seeing the unconscious motive weakens its power.

\item **Ask: Does this serve, or do I serve it?** For each significant possession or pursuit, ask: Does this tool serve my life—or has it become a master demanding my energy, attention, money, and peace? If you're serving it more than it's serving you, reconsider.

\item **Practice the ocean, not the river.** When desires arise (and they will), don't fight them. Don't indulge them reflexively. Notice them like rivers flowing into the ocean. Let them enter your awareness. Let them pass through. Remain still at the center.

\item **Gratitude without grasping.** Appreciate what you have without clinging to it. Enjoy the apartment, the car, the meal, the experience—fully, presently. Then release it. Let it be what it is: temporary, transient, here now, gone tomorrow.

\item **Hold everything lightly.** Ask yourself regularly: Could I let this go tomorrow and still be whole? If the answer is no, you've given that thing too much power. Practice imagining its loss—not to be morbid, but to remember: you're not what you own.
\end{enumerate}

This isn't easy.

The material world is designed to make us cling.

Advertising. Social media. Culture. All of it whispers the same lie:

\emph{You'll be complete when you finally have \underline{\hspace{2em}}.}

The Gītā offers the truth:

You're already complete.

The things are just things.

Use them. Enjoy them. Release them.

Be the ocean.

Not the rivers trying to fill it.

## The Way Forward: What Remains

Raj's parents visit for his fortieth birthday.

His mother walks through the apartment slowly. She's older now. Moves carefully.

She pauses at the framed /Architectural Digest/ cover.

"You were so proud of this," she says softly.

"I was," Raj admits.

"Are you still?"

He looks at the cover. The perfectly staged apartment. The version of himself that believed arrival came through square footage and marble.

"I'm proud of different things now," he says.

Like the fact that he volunteers at the community center in Queens, teaching financial literacy to immigrant families.

Like the fact that he restructured his work schedule so he's home for dinner.

Like the fact that he can sit in his apartment and feel... nothing. No pride. No shame. Just a comfortable space that serves its function.

His mother nods.

She doesn't say it, but Raj feels her understanding:

*He finally figured it out.*

That night, after his parents go to bed in the guest room, Raj sits in the Eames chair.

The city glitters below.

Same view. Same chair. Same apartment.

Different person sitting in it.

Someone who knows:

The material world is real. Useful. Beautiful, even.

But it's not ultimate.

It's the river.

He's learning to be the ocean.

## Reflection

- What are you trying to prove with your possessions? What do your clothes, your car, your home, your job, your achievements say about you that you can't say yourself? What are you outsourcing to the material world?
- Are you using your things, or are they using you? Which possessions serve your life—and which have become masters demanding your time, energy, and peace? What would it feel like to release what no longer serves?
- Can you be the ocean, not the river? When material desires arise, can you let them flow through without grasping or suppressing? Can you enjoy what comes without clinging when it goes? What would it feel like to hold everything lightly?
