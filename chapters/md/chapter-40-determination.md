# Chapter 40: Determination

## The Fourth Attempt

Keisha sits in her car in the gym parking lot.

She's been here four times this week. Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and now Saturday morning.

She's walked in exactly zero times.

Each time, she gets as far as the door. Sees people through the glass—fit, confident, moving like they belong there. And then something in her chest tightens.

*Not today.*

She tells herself she'll go tomorrow. That she just needs one more day to prepare. To feel ready.

But tomorrow never comes. And ready never arrives.

It's been six months since she signed up. Six months of monthly payments for a membership she hasn't used. Six months of promising herself, "This week will be different."

But it's not.

And sitting here, engine running, Keisha realizes: it's not going to be. Not unless something changes.

Not the gym. Not her body. Not her circumstances.

Her.

She turns off the engine. Grabs her bag. Opens the door.

And this time, she walks in.

## When Starting Isn't Enough

We all know how to start.

The first day of the diet. The first page of the book. The first step toward the goal.

Starting is easy. It's fueled by motivation, by excitement, by the vision of who we'll be when we succeed.

But then reality hits.

The diet gets boring. The book gets hard. The goal requires more effort than we imagined.

And motivation—that bright, shiny feeling that got us started—evaporates.

What's left is just the work. The repetition. The unglamorous, uncomfortable, daily choice to keep going when you'd rather quit.

This is where most people stop.

Not because they can't continue. But because they expect it to feel good. They expect motivation to carry them. They expect the path to get easier.

But it doesn't.

Keisha walks into the gym. She has no idea what to do. She picks a treadmill in the back corner where fewer people can see her.

She walks for twenty minutes. Nothing dramatic. No transformation. Just twenty minutes of movement.

The next day, her legs hurt. She doesn't want to go back.

But she does.

This is determination. Not the flashy kind that looks good in movies. The quiet, stubborn kind that shows up when it doesn't feel good. When you're tired. When you'd rather quit.

When the only reason you keep going is because you decided to.

## The Gītā Speaks: The Resolve That Doesn't Waver

Kṛṣṇa speaks about three kinds of determination. But only one leads to freedom.

> ``O son of Pṛthā, that determination which is unbreakable, which is sustained with steadfastness by yoga practice, and which thus controls the activities of the mind, life and senses is determination in the mode of goodness.''
>
> --- Bhagavad-gītā 18.33

**Unbreakable.** Not because it never bends. But because it doesn't break when things get hard.

**Sustained with steadfastness by yoga practice.** Not by motivation. Not by feelings. By practice—the daily, deliberate choice to continue.

**Controls the activities of the mind, life, and senses.** The mind says, "This is hard. Quit." The senses say, "This is uncomfortable. Stop." Determination in goodness says, "Keep going anyway."

Kṛṣṇa also warns about false determination:

> ``And that determination by which one holds fast to fruitive results in religion, economic development and sense gratification is of the nature of passion, O Arjuna.''
>
> --- Bhagavad-gītā 18.34

This is determination attached to outcomes. "I'll keep going as long as I see results. As long as it's working. As long as I'm winning."

But what happens when results slow down? When progress stalls? When you hit a plateau?

That kind of determination collapses.

True determination isn't about results. It's about commitment.

Keisha doesn't know if she'll ever look like the people she saw through the gym window. She doesn't know if this will "work."

But she's committed to showing up. Not because it's guaranteed. Because it's her decision.

## Living the Teaching: The Practice of Steady Resolve

Three months later, Keisha still goes to the gym.

Not every day. Not perfectly. But consistently.

Some days she feels strong. Most days she doesn't.

But she goes anyway.

### Practice Box

**The Practice of Unbreakable Determination**

**1. Decide once, act many times.** Make the decision once: "I'm doing this." Then stop re-deciding every time it gets hard. The decision is made. Now you just show up.

**2. Detach from feelings.** Don't wait to feel motivated. Don't wait to feel ready. Feelings are unreliable. Action is what counts.

**3. Focus on process, not results.** Commit to the action, not the outcome. Show up. Do the work. Release attachment to how quickly it pays off.

**4. Make it smaller when you need to.** If the full effort feels impossible, do less. But don't do nothing. Five minutes is better than zero minutes.

**5. Celebrate showing up.** The win isn't the transformation. The win is that you didn't quit. That's the real victory.

Keisha doesn't track her weight anymore. She tracks her attendance.

Did she show up? Yes. That's the win.

Some days she lifts weights. Some days she just walks. Some days she sits on the mat and stretches for ten minutes.

But she's there.

And slowly—so slowly she almost doesn't notice—things shift.

Not her body. Her mind.

She stops thinking of herself as someone who quits. She starts thinking of herself as someone who shows up.

That's the real transformation.

Not the muscles. Not the endurance. The identity shift from "I try and fail" to "I commit and continue."

## The Way Forward: The Long Game

A year later, Keisha is still going to the gym.

She doesn't look like a fitness model. She's not competing in marathons. She's just... consistent.

One day, a new member approaches her. Young woman, nervous, hovering near the door.

"Is it always this intimidating?" she asks.

Keisha laughs. "Yes. But you get used to it."

"How long have you been coming?"

"About a year."

The woman looks surprised. "You seem so confident."

Keisha thinks about the version of herself who sat in the parking lot for months. Who almost turned back a hundred times.

"I'm not confident," she says. "I'm just determined. There's a difference."

Confidence is a feeling. Determination is a choice.

Confidence comes and goes. Determination stays—if you decide it will.

The young woman nods. "So you just... keep showing up?"

"That's all it is," Keisha says. "You decide once. Then you stop re-deciding. You just go."

"Even when you don't want to?"

"Especially then."

Because that's when determination becomes real. Not when it's easy. When it's hard.

When every fiber of you wants to quit. And you show up anyway.

Not because you feel like it. Because you said you would.

And your word—to yourself—is unbreakable.

## Reflection

- What have you started but not sustained? What goal did motivation carry you toward—until motivation ran out? What would change if you switched from motivation to determination?
- Are you re-deciding every day, or have you decided once and committed to showing up regardless of how you feel? What would it look like to make the decision final?
- Where are you attached to results instead of committed to process? What if the win isn't the outcome but the fact that you didn't quit? Can you celebrate showing up?
