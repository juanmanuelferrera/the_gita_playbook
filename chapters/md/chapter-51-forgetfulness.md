# Chapter 51: Forgetfulness

## Opening Story

Daniel sets three alarms every night.

One to wake up for meditation. One for his morning workout. One for his gratitude practice.

Every morning, he hits snooze on all three.

By 7:30 AM, he's rushed, stressed, and already behind schedule. No meditation. No workout. No gratitude. Just coffee and crisis mode.

This has been happening for six months.

Six months ago, he went to a retreat. Had a profound experience. Saw clearly--really saw--what mattered. Who he wanted to be. How he wanted to live.

He came home transformed. Committed. Clear.

For two weeks, he did it all. Perfectly.

Then work got busy. Then his son got sick. Then there was the thing with his mother-in-law. Then just life.

And slowly, imperceptibly, he forgot.

Not intellectually. He still knows meditation is important. Still believes in presence. Still wants to live consciously.

But somehow, between knowing and doing, there's forgetting.

And now he's back where he started. Sleepwalking through life. Reactive. Stressed. Unconscious.

How does this keep happening?

## Reflective Bridge

We all know what matters.

We know we should be present. Should practice gratitude. Should meditate, exercise, connect with loved ones, live our values.

We've read the books. Been to the workshops. Had the insights.

And yet, we forget. Not because we're stupid. Because we're human. And humans are forgetting machines.

We remember what's urgent. The deadline. The email. The crisis. We forget what's important. The practice. The presence. The purpose.

Daniel remembers to check his phone forty times a day. Forgets to check in with himself once. Remembers every work meeting. Forgets the promise he made to play catch with his son.

This is the default. The gravity. The pull of unconsciousness.

And resisting it requires more than good intentions.

We forget because remembering is uncomfortable. Living consciously means facing what we're avoiding. Feeling what we're numbing. Choosing what's hard over what's easy.

"I forgot to meditate" is easier than "I chose not to meditate because sitting with myself is uncomfortable."

We don't forget randomly. We forget strategically. What we don't want to face, we conveniently don't remember.

## The Gita Speaks: The Source of Remembrance and Forgetting

Krishna reveals something startling about forgetfulness. It isn't merely a failure of willpower or discipline. It operates at a far deeper level.

> "I am seated in everyone's heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness. By all the Vedas am I to be known; indeed I am the compiler of Vedanta, and I am the knower of the Vedas."
>
> -- Bhagavad-gita 15.15

**I am seated in everyone's heart.** The Supreme is not distant. He is within--closer than your own thoughts, present in the very seat of consciousness.

**From Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness.** This is the revelation that changes everything. Remembrance and forgetfulness both come from the same divine source. Forgetfulness is not random. It is not simply a failure of your brain or your discipline. It has a deeper origin. When we turn away from what is essential, when we orient our lives toward distraction, forgetfulness follows--not as punishment, but as consequence. And when we sincerely seek what matters, remembrance is granted.

**By all the Vedas am I to be known.** The purpose of all knowledge points in one direction: toward the Supreme seated in the heart. When Daniel forgets to meditate, he isn't just forgetting a habit. He's forgetting the one who sits within him, waiting to be remembered.

And Krishna reveals the mechanism through which forgetfulness operates in the material world:

> "The Supreme Lord is situated in everyone's heart, O Arjuna, and is directing the wanderings of all living entities, who are seated as on a machine, made of the material energy."
>
> -- Bhagavad-gita 18.61

**Directing the wanderings of all living entities.** We wander. That's the word. Not marching purposefully toward our goals--wandering. Pulled this way and that by the machinery of material energy. Phone notifications. Work crises. Social obligations. The body's demands for comfort and stimulation.

**Seated as on a machine, made of the material energy.** The body and mind are a machine. And the machine has its own momentum. Its own gravity. It pulls toward distraction, toward comfort, toward forgetting. Daniel isn't weak. He's sitting on a machine that is designed to carry him away from remembrance unless he consciously steers it back.

But here's the key: the Lord who permits forgetfulness also grants remembrance. The same source offers both. The difference is the direction of the heart. Turn toward distraction, and forgetfulness deepens. Turn toward the divine, and remembrance awakens.

Daniel's problem isn't willpower. It's orientation.

## Living the Teaching

Daniel realizes: willpower isn't enough. He needs architecture. He needs to build remembrance into his environment. His schedule. His systems.

But more than systems, he needs to understand what he's actually forgetting. Not just a morning routine. He's forgetting the one seated in his heart.

He starts simply. One practice. Not three alarms for three habits. One. Sitting quietly for ten minutes, turning his attention inward, toward the presence that is already there.

### Practice Box

**The Practice of Remembrance**

**1. Recognize the source.** Remembrance and forgetfulness both come from a deeper place than your willpower. Stop blaming yourself for forgetting. Start asking: What am I oriented toward? Distraction--or the presence within?

**2. Simplify ruthlessly.** Don't try to remember ten things. Remember one. The one seated in the heart. Let everything else flow from that single orientation.

**3. Build environmental cues.** Put reminders everywhere. Not just alarms--objects, images, words that redirect your attention inward. Make forgetting harder than remembering.

**4. Return without guilt.** When you forget--and you will--don't spiral. The machine of material energy will carry you away. Just steer back. Same day. No shame. The Lord who permits forgetfulness also welcomes your return.

## The Way Forward

Daniel makes changes.

He puts his meditation cushion in the middle of the floor. Can't miss it. Can't walk past it. He tells his wife, "I'm sitting at 6 AM. Will you check on me if I'm not up?" He sets one alarm. Puts the phone across the room so he has to get up to reach it.

And slowly, it works. Not perfectly. He still forgets sometimes. Hits snooze. Skips days.

But more often than not, he remembers. And on the days he forgets, he returns. Same day. No guilt. No spiral.

Because remembrance isn't about perfection. It's about orientation. Turning the heart back toward what matters. Again and again. Despite the wandering machine that carries you elsewhere.

A year later, Daniel still meditates most mornings. His son asks, "Dad, why do you sit on that pillow every morning?"

"To remember," Daniel says.

"Remember what?"

"That something lives in my heart that's bigger than my to-do list. That I'm more than the machine I'm riding. That if I don't pause, I'll wander right past what matters."

His son nods, not fully understanding. But one morning, Daniel finds him sitting on the cushion. Eyes closed. Breathing.

"What are you doing?" Daniel asks.

"Remembering," his son says. "Like you."

And Daniel realizes: what you practice, you teach. What you remember, you pass on. His son won't remember every lesson Daniel tries to teach. But he'll remember what Daniel does. Consistently. Daily. Even imperfectly.

Remembrance. The practice of returning, again and again, to the one seated in the heart.

## Reflection

- What do you keep forgetting? What practice, promise, or presence keeps slipping away? Is it truly forgetting--or is it the machine of material energy carrying you toward distraction?
- Where is your heart oriented? Toward the presence within, or toward the endless wandering of external demands? What would it mean to reorient--even slightly--toward remembrance?
- What one thing do you want to remember? Not ten things. One. The one seated in your heart. What would your life look like if you built it around that single remembrance?
