# Chapter 18: Ambition

## The Next Rung

Natasha got the VP title at thirty-two.

Youngest in the company's history. Everyone said she was brilliant. Driven. Destined for the C-suite.

And she was. Is. She knows it.

But right now, sitting in the executive parking garage in her new car---the one she bought to celebrate the promotion---she feels empty.

Not disappointed. The promotion is real. The achievement is real. The salary increase, the corner office, the respect---all real.

But that feeling she was chasing? The one that was supposed to arrive when she finally made VP? It's not here.

She thought getting here would feel like arrival. Like crossing a finish line. Like she could finally exhale and say, "I did it. I made it. I'm successful."

Instead, what she feels is: *What's next?*

The partners track is still above her. Then there's the executive committee. Then CEO. Then maybe board positions at other companies. Then...

There's always a next rung.

And she's already thinking about it. Already strategizing. Already feeling the familiar pull: *If I just get to the next level, THEN I'll feel satisfied.*

But she felt that way about VP too. And about Director before that. And about Manager before that.

The ladder never ends. And the hunger never stops.

## Reflective Bridge

Ambition isn't bad. The desire to grow, to contribute, to build something meaningful, to develop your capacities---that's natural. Healthy. Part of being human.

But there's another kind of ambition. The kind that's never satisfied. That treats every achievement as insufficient. That makes your worth conditional on the next milestone. That whispers: *You're only as good as your last success.*

This kind of ambition operates on a simple lie: *When I achieve X, THEN I'll be enough.*

But here's what actually happens: you achieve X. For a moment, you feel satisfaction. Then the goalposts move. What felt like "the top" becomes the new baseline. And suddenly, "enough" is one level higher.

There's always another rung. And the ambition says: *Just one more. Just get to THIS level, and THEN you'll have arrived.*

But you never arrive. Because arrival isn't a place on the ladder. It's a way of relating to wherever you are.

The Bhagavad-gita addresses this directly. Not ambition itself, but the *attachment* to outcomes---the belief that achieving something external will finally make you feel complete internally.

It won't. Because completeness isn't achieved. It's recognized.

## The Gita Speaks: Control, Desire, and Transcendence

Ambition seems like strength. But Krishna reveals that uncontrolled ambition---the kind that makes peace conditional on the next achievement---is a form of bondage. The truly superior person isn't the one who achieves the most but the one who engages fully without being enslaved to results:

> "On the other hand, he who controls the senses by the mind and engages his active organs in works of devotion, without attachment, is by far superior."
>
> --- Bhagavad-gita 3.7

*Without attachment.* Not without effort. Not without excellence. Without attachment to the outcome being the source of your worth. Natasha works with extraordinary effort. But her effort is attached---chained to the next promotion, the next title, the next rung. Krishna says the superior path is full engagement with detached consciousness. Work devotionally. Strive fully. But don't let the fruit determine your peace.

Krishna continues with the principle that reframes all work:

> "Work done as a sacrifice for Vishnu has to be performed; otherwise, work binds one to this material world."
>
> --- Bhagavad-gita 3.9

Work *binds* when done for personal gain alone. Every promotion Natasha chases binds her more tightly to the ladder. The work isn't liberating her---it's trapping her. Because she works *for herself*---for her ego, her validation, her sense of worth. Work done as sacrifice---as offering to something beyond personal ambition---liberates. The same effort, directed differently, produces freedom instead of bondage.

But why is the ambition so relentless? Why can't Natasha stop at VP and feel satisfied? Krishna diagnoses the root:

> "Thus, a man's pure consciousness is covered by his eternal enemy in the form of lust, which is never satisfied and which burns like fire."
>
> --- Bhagavad-gita 3.39

*Never satisfied.* *Burns like fire.* Natasha's ambition isn't strategic planning. It's lust in professional clothing---the same insatiable craving that drives all compulsive desire, now wearing a business suit. Feed fire with fuel and it grows. Feed ambition with achievement and it demands more achievement. The mechanism is identical.

Krishna then addresses those who try to find peace through abstract goals and formless achievements:

> "For those whose minds are attached to the unmanifested, impersonal feature of the Supreme, advancement is very troublesome."
>
> --- Bhagavad-gita 12.5

Natasha is attached to the unmanifested---the idea of "success," the concept of "arrival," the formless notion of "enough." But these abstractions provide no resting place. Advancement toward an impersonal goal is troublesome because the goal keeps receding. You can't arrive at a concept. You can only arrive at something---or someone---concrete.

Krishna reveals the engine driving the whole machine:

> "The mode of passion is born of unlimited desires and longings, O son of Kunti and because of this one is bound to material fruitive activities."
>
> --- Bhagavad-gita 14.7

*Unlimited desires and longings.* That's passion---the mode that drives Natasha. Not evil. Not lazy. Passionate. Driven. And *bound*. Bound to fruitive activities---work done for the fruit, achievement pursued for the result, ambition fueled by the promise of personal gain. The mode of passion produces extraordinary effort and extraordinary bondage simultaneously.

And beneath passion, there's always the shadow:

> "O son of Bharata, know that the mode of darkness, born of ignorance, causes deception of all embodied living entities."
>
> --- Bhagavad-gita 14.8

The deception: that the next rung will satisfy. That's ignorance---not stupidity, but a fundamental misunderstanding of where satisfaction actually lives. Natasha is brilliant. And she's deceived. The two are not mutually exclusive.

But there's a way beyond both passion and ignorance:

> "One who engages in full devotional service, who does not fall down in any circumstance, at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of Brahman."
>
> --- Bhagavad-gita 14.26

*At once transcends.* Not gradually. Not after thirty more years of climbing. At once---through devotional service. Full engagement, directed not toward personal gain but toward the Supreme. This isn't the end of ambition. It's the transformation of ambition. From "I climb for myself" to "I serve with my capacities." From passion-driven bondage to devotion-driven freedom.

## Living the Teaching

Natasha starts seeing a coach.

Not because she's failing. Because she's succeeding and it feels hollow.

The coach asks her: "What are you trying to prove?"

She starts to answer---"That I'm capable, that I deserve to be here, that---"

And then stops.

*That I'm enough.*

That's what she's trying to prove. With every promotion, every achievement, every rung climbed. She's trying to prove she's enough.

"And are you?" the coach asks.

"Am I what?"

"Enough."

Natasha pauses. The honest answer: "I don't know. I thought I would be when I made VP. But I'm not. So maybe when I make partner---"

"You'll still be asking that question," the coach says. "Because you're trying to answer it with achievements. But it's not an achievement question. It's an identity question."

Over the following months, Natasha tries something new. She keeps working. Keeps striving. Keeps doing excellent work.

But she stops making her worth conditional on the next promotion.

She begins to notice the mode of passion operating---the unlimited desires and longings that bind her to fruitive activity. She can feel the fire burning: *More. Higher. Next.* And she recognizes it for what Krishna described: an eternal enemy in the form of lust, never satisfied.

When she's passed over for a project she wanted, instead of spiraling into "I'm not good enough," she asks: "Did I do my best work? Yes. Did I learn something? Yes. Is my worth dependent on getting that project? No."

When ambition arises---the pull toward the next level---she doesn't suppress it. But she doesn't obey it either. She watches it. *There's the passion. The hunger for more. The deception that the next achievement will finally be enough.*

And she chooses differently. Not to stop striving. But to stop making satisfaction conditional on outcomes. She can want the partnership. Can work toward it. But her peace doesn't depend on getting it.

### Practice Box

1. **Name what you're actually chasing.** Is it the title? Or the feeling you think the title will give you? Separate the achievement from the identity need driving it.

2. **Recognize the mode of passion.** Unlimited desires and longings. Bound to fruitive activities. When ambition feels compulsive rather than purposeful, you're operating in passion. Name it.

3. **Transform ambition into offering.** The same energy that drives "I climb for myself" can be redirected into "I serve with my capacities." Work done as sacrifice liberates. Work done for ego binds. The effort is identical. The orientation changes everything.

4. **Control the senses, engage devotionally.** Don't withdraw from work. Engage your active organs fully---but without attachment to the fruit. The superior person isn't the one who achieves the most. It's the one who engages the most freely.

## The Way Forward

Two years later, Natasha makes partner.

She gets the call. The congratulations. The announcement. Everything she worked toward for a decade.

And she feels... good. Satisfied. Accomplished.

But not complete. Because she already knows: completeness wasn't in the title.

That evening, a younger colleague asks her: "How does it feel? You made it. You're at the top."

Natasha smiles. "I'm not at the top. There's always another level. But I'm also not trying to get there to prove I'm enough anymore."

"Then why do it?"

"Because the work is interesting. Because I can contribute. Because I'm good at it. But my worth isn't on the line every time I succeed or fail."

The colleague looks confused.

But Natasha knows better now.

Success is fine. Achievement is fine. Ambition is fine. But none of them make you enough. They can't. Because you're already enough---not as an achievement, but as a fact of your existence. The eternal self doesn't climb ladders. It witnesses the climb.

A few months later, an opportunity comes: CEO of a smaller company. High risk. High reward. The kind of thing the old Natasha would have jumped at without thinking.

This Natasha considers it carefully. Not "Will this make me successful?" But: "Is this my dharma? Is this work I can offer as sacrifice? Or is this the fire of lust, burning, never satisfied, demanding more fuel?"

She decides no. Not because she's afraid. Not because she couldn't do it. But because it's not aligned with what actually matters to her: impact, creativity, time with the people she loves.

The ambition voice screams: *You're settling! You're giving up! You could be CEO!*

The mode of passion, pulling. Unlimited desires and longings.

But she's learned to hear another voice---quieter, steadier. The voice that says: engage fully, without attachment. Work as sacrifice, not as self-proof. Transcend the modes. Come to the level of Brahman.

She's not giving up. She's choosing. And choosing from a place of already being enough, rather than trying to prove she is.

That's freedom. Not freedom from ambition. But freedom from being enslaved by it.

The ladder is infinite. But she's not on it anymore. She's here. Now. Doing work that matters---not to prove she's enough, but because she already is.

## Reflection

- What are you trying to prove with your ambition? To whom?
- Can you recognize the mode of passion operating---the unlimited desires, the bondage to fruitive activity, the fire that burns but never satisfies?
- What would your work look like if it were sacrifice rather than self-proof---offering rather than acquisition?
