# Chapter 50: Repression

## Opening Story

"How are you doing?"

"Fine! Good. Really good, actually."

Lisa smiles. Bright. Convincing.

Inside, she's screaming.

Her marriage is crumbling. Her mother is dying. Her company is laying people off and she's pretty sure she's on the list.

But she says she's fine. Because that's what she does. What she's always done.

Push it down. Lock it up. Keep moving.

Her therapist calls it repression. Her mother called it being strong. Her husband calls it being distant.

Lisa doesn't know what to call it. She just knows it's how she survives.

Feeling things--really feeling them--is dangerous. If she starts, she might not stop. The dam might break. Everything she's been holding might flood out and drown her.

So she doesn't start. She gets up. Goes to work. Smiles. Performs competence. Keeps it together.

And at night, alone in her car before going inside, she sits in the driveway and feels nothing. She wants to cry. Scream. Break something. But she can't access it. It's all locked away somewhere deep. Somewhere she doesn't know how to reach anymore.

## Reflective Bridge

Repression feels like strength. It's not weakness to stuff your feelings. It's discipline. Control. Maturity.

That's what Lisa learned growing up. Her father left when she was twelve. Her mother didn't cry. Didn't rage. Didn't break down. She just kept going. Worked two jobs. Raised three kids. Never complained.

"We don't have the luxury of falling apart," she'd say. "So we don't."

And Lisa learned: feelings are a luxury. Something for people who have the space to feel them. Successful people push through.

Lisa has been successful. Career. Marriage. Home. Life that looks perfect from the outside.

Except it's hollow.

Because what you repress doesn't disappear. It metastasizes.

The anger she didn't express at her father comes out as irritation at her husband. The grief she didn't feel when her best friend moved away comes out as numbness toward new relationships. The fear she didn't acknowledge about her job comes out as anxiety about everything else.

Repression doesn't solve anything. It just relocates the problem. Buries it. Lets it rot inside you.

Her body knows. Chronic headaches. Stomach issues. Insomnia. Panic attacks that come out of nowhere. Her body is screaming what her mind won't acknowledge: this isn't working. You're not fine. You need to feel this.

But she doesn't know how.

## The Gita Speaks: What Repression Cannot Accomplish

The Bhagavad-gita doesn't advocate repression. It questions it directly--with a bluntness that stops you cold.

> "Even a man of knowledge acts according to his own nature, for everyone follows his nature. What can repression accomplish?"
>
> -- Bhagavad-gita 3.33

Read that again.

**Even a man of knowledge.** Not a fool. Not someone weak-willed. Even someone wise, educated, disciplined--even that person acts according to their nature. Knowledge alone doesn't override what lives inside you.

**Everyone follows his nature.** This is not pessimism. It's realism. You have a nature. Emotions, tendencies, responses that are woven into who you are. They don't vanish because you refuse to acknowledge them.

**What can repression accomplish?** This is Krishna's challenge. Not a rhetorical flourish--a genuine question. What has pushing it down actually achieved? Has it healed anything? Resolved anything? Or has it simply moved the pain from one room to another, where it festers unseen?

Lisa has been repressing for thirty years. And what has it accomplished?

Headaches. Insomnia. A marriage where her husband can't reach her. A life that looks perfect and feels hollow.

Repression accomplished exactly nothing.

The feelings didn't go away. They went underground. And underground, they grew roots.

Krishna doesn't say: feel nothing. He doesn't say: let your emotions run wild. He says: repression doesn't work. You cannot override your nature by pretending it doesn't exist.

The alternative isn't collapse. It's acknowledgment. Feeling what is there so you can work with it rather than against it. Integration, not suppression.

Lisa has been treating her emotions like enemies to be conquered. Krishna suggests they are her nature--to be understood, not crushed.

## Living the Teaching

Lisa's therapist gives her homework.

"Fifteen minutes a day," she says. "Just sit. Feel whatever comes up. Don't push it away."

"What if nothing comes up?"

"Then feel the nothing. But don't distract. No phone. No TV. Just you and whatever's there."

Lisa tries. First day, she lasts four minutes before grabbing her phone. Second day, six minutes.

Third day, she sits for the full fifteen. And halfway through, something breaks. She starts crying. Not gentle tears. Sobbing. Ugly. Loud.

She doesn't even know what she's crying about. Everything. Nothing. Years of unfelt feelings flooding out.

And it's terrifying. And exhausting. And liberating.

Because the feelings don't destroy her. They pass through. Like weather. Intense. Real. But temporary.

And on the other side of them, there's clarity.

### Practice Box

**The Practice of Integration, Not Repression**

**1. Ask Krishna's question honestly.** Look at what you've been repressing and ask: What has this accomplished? Has suppressing it healed anything? Or has it simply relocated the pain?

**2. Feel it in your body.** Where does the repressed emotion live? Chest? Stomach? Throat? Let yourself experience the physical sensation without trying to make it stop.

**3. Name what surfaces.** Don't judge it. Don't fix it. Just name it. "I'm angry." "I'm scared." "I'm grieving." Acknowledgment is the first step toward working with your nature instead of against it.

**4. Let it move through you.** Cry. Write it out. Move your body. Emotions need expression--not explosion, but a channel. What you feel, you can process. What you repress, owns you.

## The Way Forward

She talks to her husband. Really talks. About how scared she is. How disconnected she feels. How much she needs him.

He cries. "I've been trying to reach you for years. But you were always 'fine.'"

"I'm not fine," she says. "I haven't been fine in a long time. But I'm trying to be honest now."

Six months later, Lisa's mother dies. And Lisa grieves. Openly. Fully. She doesn't hold it together at the funeral. She cries. She lets people see her broken.

A relative says, "You're being so brave."

Lisa laughs through tears. "I'm not being brave. I'm just feeling what I feel. For the first time in my life."

Because repression isn't strength. It's fear. Fear that if you feel, you'll be overwhelmed. Destroyed.

But the opposite is true. What you feel, you can process. What you repress, controls you.

Krishna asked: What can repression accomplish?

Lisa finally has her answer: Nothing. Nothing at all.

The path forward isn't around the feeling. It's through it. Feel it. All of it. And discover you're strong enough to survive it.

You always were.

## Reflection

- What emotion are you repressing right now? What are you telling yourself you can't afford to feel? Ask Krishna's question honestly: What has that repression accomplished?
- When was the last time you let yourself fully feel something difficult? What happens when you imagine allowing yourself to cry, to rage, to grieve without controlling it?
- What would it mean to work with your nature instead of against it? Can you sit with discomfort for fifteen minutes today? What might surface if you stopped pushing it down?
