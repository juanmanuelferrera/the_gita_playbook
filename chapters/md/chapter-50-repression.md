# Chapter 50: Repression

## The Smile

"How are you doing?"

"Fine! Good. Really good, actually."

Lisa smiles. Bright. Convincing.

Inside, she's screaming.

Her marriage is crumbling. Her mother is dying. Her company is laying people off and she's pretty sure she's on the list.

But she says she's fine.

Because that's what she does. What she's always done.

Push it down. Lock it up. Keep moving.

Her therapist calls it repression. Her mother called it being strong. Her husband calls it being distant.

Lisa doesn't know what to call it. She just knows it's how she survives.

Feeling things—really feeling them—is dangerous. If she starts, she might not stop. The dam might break. Everything she's been holding might flood out and drown her.

So she doesn't start.

She gets up. Goes to work. Smiles. Performs competence. Keeps it together.

And at night, alone in her car before going inside, she sits in the driveway and... nothing. Feels nothing.

She wants to cry. Scream. Break something.

But she can't access it. It's all locked away. Somewhere deep. Somewhere she doesn't know how to reach anymore.

## The Tyranny of Control

Repression feels like strength.

It's not weakness to stuff your feelings. It's discipline. Control. Maturity.

Weak people fall apart. Strong people hold it together.

That's what Lisa learned growing up. Her father left when she was twelve. Her mother didn't cry. Didn't rage. Didn't break down.

She just... kept going. Worked two jobs. Raised three kids. Never complained.

"We don't have the luxury of falling apart," she'd say. "So we don't."

And Lisa learned: feelings are a luxury. An indulgence. Something for people who have the space to feel them.

But successful people? They push through.

And Lisa has been successful. Career. Marriage. Home. Life that looks perfect from the outside.

Except it's hollow.

Because what you repress doesn't disappear. It metastasizes.

The anger she didn't express at her father comes out as irritation at her husband.

The grief she didn't feel when her best friend moved away comes out as numbness toward new relationships.

The fear she didn't acknowledge about her job comes out as anxiety about everything else.

Repression doesn't solve anything. It just relocates the problem. Buries it. Lets it rot inside you.

And Lisa is rotting from the inside out.

Her body knows. Chronic headaches. Stomach issues. Insomnia. Panic attacks that come out of nowhere.

Her body is screaming what her mind won't acknowledge: this isn't working. You're not fine. You need to feel this.

But she doesn't know how.

## The Gītā Speaks: What You Resist Controls You

The Bhagavad-gītā doesn't advocate repression.

It advocates transformation. Which requires first acknowledging what is.

> ``The embodied soul may be restricted from sense enjoyment, though the taste for sense objects remains. But, ceasing such engagements by experiencing a higher taste, he is fixed in consciousness.''
>
> --- Bhagavad-gītā 2.59

**Restricted from sense enjoyment.** You can suppress behavior. Stop eating. Stop drinking. Stop whatever external action.

**Though the taste remains.** But the desire doesn't go away. It's still there. Festering.

**By experiencing a higher taste.** The only way to actually release desire isn't repression—it's replacement. Finding something that satisfies more deeply.

But you can't replace what you won't acknowledge.

Later, Kṛṣṇa warns explicitly against false control:

> ``One who restrains the senses of action but whose mind dwells on sense objects certainly deludes himself and is called a pretender.''
>
> --- Bhagavad-gītā 3.6

**Restrains the senses... but whose mind dwells.** This is repression. Outwardly controlled. Inwardly obsessed.

**Deludes himself.** You think you're dealing with it. You're not. You're just pretending.

**Called a pretender.** The Gītā is blunt. If you're suppressing without transforming, you're faking it.

Real freedom isn't control. It's integration.

Feeling the feeling. Acknowledging it. Understanding it. And then choosing how to respond.

Not "don't feel anger." But "feel the anger, understand its source, and choose not to act from it."

That's transformation. Not repression.

## Living the Teaching: The Practice of Feeling

Lisa's therapist gives her homework.

"Fifteen minutes a day," she says. "Just sit. Feel whatever comes up. Don't push it away."

"What if nothing comes up?"

"Then feel the nothing. But don't distract. No phone. No TV. Just you and whatever's there."

Lisa tries. First day, she lasts four minutes before grabbing her phone.

Second day, six minutes.

Third day, she sits for the full fifteen. And halfway through, something breaks.

She starts crying. Not gentle tears. Sobbing. Ugly. Loud.

She doesn't even know what she's crying about. Everything. Nothing. Years of unfelt feelings flooding out.

And it's terrifying. And exhausting. And... liberating.

### Practice Box

**The Practice of Integration, Not Repression**

**1. Name what you're feeling.** Don't judge it. Don't fix it. Just name it. "I'm angry." "I'm scared." "I'm sad." Acknowledgment is the first step.

**2. Feel it in your body.** Where is it? Chest? Stomach? Throat? Let yourself experience the physical sensation without trying to make it stop.

**3. Ask what it's telling you.** Emotions are information. What is this feeling pointing toward? What need isn't being met? What truth are you avoiding?

**4. Let it move through you.** Cry. Yell into a pillow. Write it out. Move your body. Emotions need expression. Give them a channel.

**5. Choose your response consciously.** After feeling it fully, decide what action—if any—is appropriate. Not reaction. Response. Conscious choice.

Lisa starts feeling. Really feeling.

The anger at her father who left. The grief about her mother's decline. The terror about losing her job.

And something surprising happens: the feelings don't destroy her.

They pass through. Like weather. Intense. Real. But temporary.

And on the other side of them, there's clarity.

She talks to her husband. Really talks. About how scared she is. How disconnected she feels. How much she needs him.

He cries. "I've been trying to reach you for years. But you were always 'fine.'"

"I'm not fine," she says. "I haven't been fine in a long time. But I'm trying to be honest now. With you. With myself."

It's messy. It's vulnerable. It's terrifying.

But it's real.

And real—even when it's hard—is better than the perfect facade that's slowly killing you.

## The Way Forward: The Freedom in Feeling

Six months later, Lisa's mother dies.

And Lisa grieves. Openly. Fully.

She doesn't hold it together at the funeral. She cries. She lets people see her broken.

A relative says, "You're being so brave."

Lisa laughs through tears. "I'm not being brave. I'm just... feeling what I feel. For the first time in my life."

Because repression isn't strength. It's fear.

Fear that if you feel, you'll be overwhelmed. Destroyed. Consumed.

But the opposite is true.

What you feel, you can process. What you repress, owns you.

Emotions aren't the enemy. Repression is.

Feel the anger. Feel the grief. Feel the fear.

Let it move through you. Let it teach you. Let it transform you.

And then choose—consciously, clearly—how to respond.

That's not weakness. That's wisdom.

That's not falling apart. That's integration.

That's not losing control. That's finding freedom.

Because you can't heal what you won't feel.

And you can't transform what you won't acknowledge.

The path forward isn't around the feeling. It's through it.

Feel it. All of it.

And discover that you're strong enough to survive it.

You always were.

## Reflection

- What emotion are you repressing? What are you telling yourself you can't afford to feel? What's the cost of that repression in your body, your relationships, your life?
- When was the last time you let yourself fully feel something difficult? What happens when you imagine allowing yourself to cry, to rage, to grieve without trying to control it?
- What would it mean to feel consciously instead of repress automatically? Can you sit with discomfort for fifteen minutes today? What might surface if you stopped pushing it down?
