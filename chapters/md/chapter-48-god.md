# Chapter 48: God

## The Question

"What is God?"

The child asks this while they're walking home from school. Eight years old. Completely sincere.

Vijay freezes.

He's a scientist. An astrophysicist. He studies the measurable universe -- galaxies, black holes, cosmic radiation.

His daughter is asking about the unmeasurable.

"Well," he starts, then stops.

What *is* God?

The question haunts him all evening. Through dinner. Through bedtime stories. Into the night when he should be sleeping.

He's always considered himself an agnostic. Not atheist -- too definitive. But not believer either. Just uncertain. Waiting for evidence.

But his daughter's question reveals something uncomfortable: he's never actually investigated. Never looked deeply. Never asked seriously.

He's dismissed the question as unanswerable. And moved on.

But what if it's not unanswerable? What if he's just never looked in the right place?

## Reflective Bridge

Vijay approaches God the way he'd approach any scientific problem.

First: define what you're looking for.

But that's the problem. Everyone defines God differently.

The Christians say God is personal -- Father, Son, Spirit. The Muslims say God is one, absolute, transcendent. The Buddhists don't even use the word. The Hindus have millions of gods -- or one God with infinite forms -- depending on who you ask.

How do you investigate something no one can agree on?

Vijay tries a different approach. Instead of asking what people say about God, he asks: what would God have to be?

If God exists, what properties would God necessarily have?

Infinite. Otherwise limited, and therefore not God.

Eternal. Otherwise created, and therefore not God.

Conscious. Otherwise less than humans, and therefore not God.

The source of everything. Otherwise dependent, and therefore not God.

So if God exists, God must be: infinite, eternal, conscious, and the source of all existence.

That's a workable definition. But does anything matching that description exist?

Vijay doesn't know. But now, at least, he knows what he's looking for.

## The Gita Speaks: God Describes Himself

Most discussions about God are humans speculating about God. The Bhagavad-gita does something different: God speaks for Himself. Krishna doesn't argue for His existence. He describes His nature -- precisely, without apology.

> "In order to deliver the pious and to annihilate the miscreants, as well as to reestablish the principles of religion, I advent Myself millennium after millennium."
>
> -- Bhagavad-gita 4.8

**I advent Myself.** God isn't passive. He enters history. Not once, as a singular event, but repeatedly -- millennium after millennium. This is a God who acts, who intervenes, who refuses to remain abstract.

Vijay's agnosticism is built on absence -- "I see no evidence of God." But Krishna says God comes personally, again and again. The question isn't whether God acts. It's whether Vijay is looking in the right places.

> "One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna."
>
> -- Bhagavad-gita 4.9

**One who knows the transcendental nature.** Not blind faith. Knowledge. Understanding the nature of God's appearance and activities. This is an invitation to investigate -- not to accept without examination, but to know.

**Attains My eternal abode.** The consequence of knowing God isn't merely intellectual satisfaction. It's liberation. The stakes couldn't be higher.

Then Krishna states His position with absolute clarity:

> "I am the source of all spiritual and material worlds. Everything emanates from Me. The wise who know this perfectly engage in My devotional service and worship Me with all their hearts."
>
> -- Bhagavad-gita 10.8

**The source of all spiritual and material worlds.** This matches Vijay's criteria exactly. Infinite. Eternal. Conscious. The source of everything. Krishna isn't claiming to be one god among many. He's claiming to be the origin of all that exists.

**The wise who know this perfectly.** Wisdom leads to devotion. For those who truly understand, worship isn't superstition -- it's the only rational response to recognizing the source of everything.

Now Krishna reveals something that should arrest any physicist:

> "I am seated in everyone's heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness. By all the Vedas am I to be known; indeed I am the compiler of Vedanta, and I am the knower of the Vedas."
>
> -- Bhagavad-gita 15.15

**Seated in everyone's heart.** God isn't remote. He's the most intimate presence there is -- closer than your own thoughts.

**From Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness.** This is staggering. The very capacity to think -- to remember, to know, to forget -- originates in God. Consciousness itself is God's gift. Vijay uses his mind to question whether God exists, but Krishna says that very mind is sustained by Him.

**By all the Vedas am I to be known.** All scripture, all knowledge, all investigation -- it all points in one direction.

And finally, the verse that connects God's presence to every living being's experience:

> "The Supreme Lord is situated in everyone's heart, O Arjuna, and is directing the wanderings of all living entities, who are seated as on a machine, made of the material energy."
>
> -- Bhagavad-gita 18.61

**Directing the wanderings.** Not controlling like a puppeteer. Directing -- overseeing, facilitating, enabling. The body is the machine. The soul is the passenger. And God is present -- in every heart, guiding, witnessing, waiting to be recognized.

Vijay has been searching the cosmos for God. Krishna says: look inside.

## Living the Teaching

Vijay can't prove God exists. Not with the tools of astrophysics.

But he realizes: that's not the right question.

The right question is: can he experience what "God" points toward?

He starts meditating. Not religiously. Experimentally.

If consciousness is fundamental -- if God is seated in the heart -- can he experience that?

### Practice Box

**The Practice of Investigating God**

**1. Define clearly.** What are you looking for? Not what others say, but what would "God" have to be? Start with clear definitions, as Vijay did.

**2. Let God speak.** Instead of only reading human opinions about God, read what God says about Himself. The Gita is a starting point. Approach it as testimony, not just text.

**3. Look inside.** Krishna says He is seated in the heart. Sit quietly. Look for the awareness behind your awareness. What sustains your capacity to think?

**4. Consider the stakes.** If Krishna is right -- if knowing God's nature leads to liberation -- the investigation isn't casual. It's the most important inquiry of your life.

Vijay sits. Closes his eyes. Watches his breath.

At first, just thoughts. Distractions. The usual mental noise.

But then, gradually, something else.

A space. An awareness. Something watching the thoughts without being the thoughts.

He can't grasp it. Can't hold it. Can't measure it.

But it's there. Undeniably there.

And it's not separate from him. It's what he is. Beneath the thoughts. Beneath the identity. Beneath "Vijay."

He thinks of Krishna's words: *From Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness.* Where does his awareness come from? Not from neurons -- that explains the hardware, not the experience. Where does the experience of being conscious originate?

He doesn't have an answer. But he has a direction.

Three months later, his daughter asks again. "Dad, did you ever figure out what God is?"

Vijay smiles. "I'm still investigating. But I found something interesting."

"What?"

"A book where God describes Himself. He says He's the source of everything. That He's in everyone's heart. That remembrance, knowledge, even forgetfulness come from Him."

She frowns. "How do you know He's telling the truth?"

Vijay laughs. She's a scientist's daughter, all right.

"I don't know for certain," he says. "But here's what I notice: when I look for the source of my own awareness -- when I try to find where my consciousness comes from -- I can't find a beginning. It's just... there. Fundamental. And this book says that's because it comes from God. I can't prove it. But I can't dismiss it either."

"So you believe now?"

"I'm investigating," Vijay says. "Which is more than I was doing before. And the investigation itself -- it's changing me."

## The Way Forward

Vijay still doesn't call himself religious.

But he meditates daily. Reads the Gita. Investigates consciousness with the same rigor he brings to astrophysics.

A colleague asks, "So you believe in God now?"

Vijay thinks about it. "I believe the question deserves serious investigation. And I believe the Gita offers a description of God that's more precise than anything I've encountered -- infinite, eternal, conscious, the source of everything, seated in every heart. Whether I call that God or the ground of being, the description demands engagement."

"But you can't prove it."

"No. But I can't prove consciousness exists either -- not with the tools of physics. And yet I experience it every waking moment. Some realities require a different kind of evidence. Direct experience. And that's what I'm pursuing."

Because God isn't a hypothesis to accept or reject.

God is -- according to Krishna -- the reality seated in your heart, the source of your awareness, the origin of all worlds, who descends again and again to reestablish truth.

That's not vague. That's specific. Testable -- not by instruments, but by attention.

The question isn't whether God is real.

The question is whether you're willing to look where God says He can be found.

Not in the cosmos. In the heart.

Not through argument. Through attention.

Not someday. Now.

## Reflection

- What is your working definition of God? Not what you've been told, but what would God have to be for the word to mean something real?
- Krishna says He is seated in your heart and that from Him come remembrance, knowledge, and forgetfulness. What would it mean to take that claim seriously -- not as doctrine, but as an experiment?
- Have you investigated or assumed? Have you looked inward for the source of consciousness, or have you decided the question is unanswerable without actually asking it?
