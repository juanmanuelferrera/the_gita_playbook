# Chapter 35: Decisions

## Opening Story

Liam has two job offers sitting on his desk.

Offer A: Senior architect at a prestigious firm in New York. Double his current salary. Corner office. Status. Everything he has worked toward for ten years.

Offer B: Lead designer at a nonprofit in his hometown. Designing affordable housing. Modest salary. Small team. Meaningful work.

He has forty-eight hours to decide.

And he is paralyzed.

His girlfriend says New York is the obvious choice. "You'd be insane to turn down that money."

His mother says hometown. "You've been gone too long. Come home. Do something that matters."

His mentor says follow the prestige. "You can always do good work later. Build your reputation first."

Everyone has an opinion. And they all sound right.

Liam makes a pro-and-con list. Updates it daily. It does not help.

Because this is not about pros and cons. It is about who he wants to become. What kind of life he wants to live. What he will regret more when he is seventy.

And he has no idea.

The paralysis is not from lack of information. It is from too much. Too many voices. Too many considerations. Too many possible futures collapsing into this single choice.

So he does what most people do when facing a big decision: He freezes. Waits. Hopes the answer will become obvious.

But time does not clarify. It just runs out.

## Reflective Bridge

Big decisions terrify us because they feel final. Irreversible. Like choosing one path means forever abandoning all the others.

So we delay. Gather more information. Consult more people. Make more lists.

But here is the truth: The perfect decision does not exist.

Because you cannot know the future. Cannot predict which choice will lead to happiness, success, or fulfillment. Cannot control the ten thousand variables that will shape the outcome.

All you can do is choose. And then make your choice right by how you live it.

Liam is waiting for certainty. For a guarantee that whichever job he picks will be the "right" one.

But certainty does not exist. Not before the choice. Only after, when you commit to making it work.

The Gita addresses this directly. Not as self-help advice, but as spiritual law.

## The Gita Speaks: Get Up and Fight

Arjuna faces a decision that makes Liam's look trivial.

Fight his own family in a war that will kill thousands? Or walk away, abdicate his duty, and let injustice prevail?

Both options feel impossible. Both come with enormous consequences. Both will haunt him.

And he freezes. Exactly like Liam.

"I don't know what is better," he tells Krishna, "whether we should conquer them or they should conquer us."

Translation: I am paralyzed. Tell me what to do.

But Krishna does not hand him a pro-and-con list. He does not weigh options or calculate outcomes. He cuts through the paralysis with a single command:

> "O son of Kunti, either you are killed on the battlefield and go to the heavenly planets, or you triumph and enjoy the earthly kingdom. So get up with determination, and fight."
>
> --- Bhagavad-gita 2.37

Read that carefully.

Krishna does not tell Arjuna which outcome will happen. He does not promise victory. He does not guarantee survival. He says: Either you die and attain heaven, or you win and enjoy the kingdom. Either way, the result is favorable.

So get up. With determination. And fight.

This is the antidote to decision paralysis. Not more analysis. Not more opinions. Not a guarantee of the right outcome. Just the recognition that both paths lead somewhere worth going, and the only losing move is to sit frozen on the ground refusing to choose.

Liam is Arjuna on that battlefield. Sitting between two futures, paralyzed by the fear of choosing wrong.

But Krishna's message is clear: There is no "wrong" choice between two genuine paths. There is only the refusal to choose, which guarantees you go nowhere.

Get up with determination, and fight.

Not "get up once you are certain." Not "get up when the analysis is complete." Not "get up when everyone agrees."

Get up with determination. Now.

## Living the Teaching

So what does Liam do?

Flip a coin? Take the money? Do what his girlfriend says?

No. He needs to stop waiting for certainty and start acting with determination.

### Practice Box

**The Determination Decision Practice**

**1. Accept that both paths lead somewhere worth going.** If you are choosing between two genuine options, neither is a disaster. Stop looking for the "right" answer. There is no wrong battlefield.

**2. Silence the external voices.** Stop asking everyone's opinion. Their advice reflects their values, not yours. You need to hear your own voice first. Krishna spoke to Arjuna alone.

**3. Get up with determination.** Choose. Not with certainty. With resolve. The quality of your decision is determined not by which option you pick, but by the determination you bring to it after choosing.

**4. Fight.** Once you choose, commit fully. No hedging. No looking back. No "what if." You are on the battlefield now. Act.

## The Way Forward

Liam stops making lists.

Stops asking people what they think.

Instead, he sits quietly. Alone. With Krishna's words echoing: Either you are killed on the battlefield and go to the heavenly planets, or you triumph and enjoy the earthly kingdom.

Either way, the result is favorable.

New York: He builds an impressive career, earns well, gains status. That is a life. A real one.

Hometown: He designs homes for people who have never had a safe place to live. That is a life. A real one.

Neither is a disaster. Neither is a mistake. Both lead somewhere worth going.

The question is not which is right. The question is: Which will he get up for with determination?

And the answer comes. Not as logic, but as feeling:

He would get up at five in the morning with determination to design affordable housing. He would not get up at five in the morning with determination for a corner office.

He calls his girlfriend that night.

"I'm taking the nonprofit job."

Silence. Then: "Are you serious? You're choosing poverty over success?"

"I'm choosing the battlefield where I'll actually fight. Not the one that looks impressive from the stands."

She does not understand. They break up two weeks later.

It hurts. But Liam knows: If she could not support the fight he chose, the relationship was already over.

He moves home. Takes the nonprofit job. Designs affordable housing for people who have never had a safe place to live.

The first year is hard. The pay is tight. The work is frustrating. He questions his choice a dozen times.

But he does not regret it.

Because he got up with determination. He did not sit frozen between two futures, waiting for a certainty that would never come. He chose a battlefield and he fights on it. Every day.

Five years later, his work wins a national award for community impact. The prestigious New York firm reaches out: "We saw your project. Want to join us and do this at scale?"

Liam considers it. But this time, he is not paralyzed.

Because he knows his battlefield now. And Krishna's teaching holds: Either outcome is favorable. The only failure is refusing to fight.

Get up with determination. That is the whole teaching on decisions.

Everything else is commentary.

## Reflection

- What decision are you avoiding? Are you waiting for certainty, or are you simply afraid to choose?
- Can you see that both paths lead somewhere worth going? What changes when you stop looking for the "right" answer and start looking for the fight you are willing to commit to?
- What would it mean to get up with determination today? Not with confidence. Not with certainty. Just with resolve?
