# Chapter 35: Decisions

## The Fork in the Road

Liam has two job offers sitting on his desk.

Offer A: Senior architect at a prestigious firm in New York. Double his current salary. Corner office. Status. Everything he's worked toward for ten years.

Offer B: Lead designer at a nonprofit in his hometown. Designing affordable housing. Modest salary. Small team. Meaningful work.

He has forty-eight hours to decide.

And he's paralyzed.

His girlfriend says New York is the obvious choice. "You'd be insane to turn down that money."

His mother says hometown. "You've been gone too long. Come home. Do something that matters."

His mentor says follow the prestige. "You can always do good work later. Build your reputation first."

Everyone has an opinion. And they all sound right.

Liam makes a pro/con list. Updates it daily. It doesn't help.

Because this isn't about pros and cons. It's about who he wants to become. What kind of life he wants to live. What he'll regret more when he's seventy.

And he has no idea.

The paralysis isn't from lack of information. It's from too much. Too many voices. Too many considerations. Too many possible futures collapsing into this single choice.

So he does what most people do when facing a big decision: He freezes. Waits. Hopes the answer will become obvious.

But time doesn't clarify. It just runs out.

## Decision Paralysis

Big decisions terrify us because they feel final. Irreversible. Like choosing one path means forever abandoning all the others.

So we delay. Gather more information. Consult more people. Make more lists.

But here's the truth: The perfect decision doesn't exist.

Because you can't know the future. Can't predict which choice will lead to happiness, success, or fulfillment. Can't control the ten thousand variables that will shape the outcome.

All you can do is choose. And then make your choice right by how you live it.

Liam is waiting for certainty. For a guarantee that whichever job he picks will be the "right" one.

But certainty doesn't exist. Not before the choice. Only after—when you commit to making it work.

The Gītā addresses this directly. Not as self-help advice, but as spiritual law.

## The Gītā Speaks: Choose Your Dharma

Arjuna faces a decision that makes Liam's look trivial.

Fight his own family in a war that will kill thousands? Or walk away, abdicate his duty, and let injustice prevail?

Both options feel impossible. Both come with enormous consequences. Both will haunt him.

And he freezes. Exactly like Liam.

"I don't know what is better," he tells Kṛṣṇa, "whether we should conquer them or they should conquer us."

Translation: *I'm paralyzed. Tell me what to do.*

But Kṛṣṇa doesn't give him the answer. He gives him the framework:

> ``It is far better to perform one's own prescribed duty, even though it may be of lesser quality, than to do another's duty perfectly. Destruction in the course of performing one's own duty is better than engaging in another's duties, for to follow another's path is dangerous.''
>
> --- Bhagavad-gītā 3.35

This is the key: The "right" decision isn't the one that looks best on paper. It's the one aligned with your /dharma/—your essential nature and function.

For Arjuna, that means fighting. Not because war is good, but because he's a warrior. It's his nature. Walking away would betray who he is.

For Liam? The question isn't which job pays more or impresses more people. It's: Which aligns with who you actually are?

Do you value status and ambition? Then New York.

Do you value community and contribution? Then hometown.

There's no objective "right." Only alignment or betrayal.

And then Kṛṣṇa adds this critical piece:

> ``You have a right to perform your prescribed duty, but you are not entitled to the fruits of action. Never consider yourself to be the cause of the results of your activities.''
>
> --- Bhagavad-gītā 2.47

You can't control the outcome. The New York job might be miserable. The hometown job might be perfect. Or vice versa.

You can only choose based on your duty—and then release attachment to how it turns out.

That's the liberation: You're not choosing a guaranteed future. You're choosing alignment. Today.

## Living the Teaching: The Alignment Decision Practice

So what does Liam do?

Flip a coin? Take the money? Do what his girlfriend says?

No.

He needs to stop asking everyone else and start asking himself.

Here's the practice:

### Practice Box

**The Dharma Decision Practice**

**1. Silence the external voices.**
Stop asking everyone's opinion. Their advice reflects their values, not yours. You need to hear your own voice first.

**2. Ask: Which choice aligns with who I actually am?**
Not who you wish you were. Not who you're supposed to be. Who you are—your gifts, values, and nature. That's your dharma.

**3. Imagine each choice at age seventy.**
Which will you regret more? Not which might fail, but which will feel like a betrayal of yourself? Choose the one you can live with.

**4. Decide—then commit fully.**
No hedging. No looking back. Choose, and then make it right through how you show up. The choice matters less than the commitment.

This is hard. Because it means taking responsibility. You can't blame others if it doesn't work out. Can't say, "I was just following their advice."

But that's also the freedom: It's your life. Your choice. Your path.

## The Way Forward: The Choice

Liam stops making lists.

Stops asking people what they think.

Instead, he sits quietly. Alone. With the question:

*Which choice would I regret more?*

And the answer comes—not as logic, but as feeling:

He'd regret New York. Not because it's bad, but because it's not him.

He doesn't actually care about corner offices. Doesn't value prestige for its own sake. Never has.

What he values—what's always driven him—is building things that matter. That serve people. That make the world slightly better.

The New York job would be impressive. Well-paid. Respectable.

But it wouldn't be his dharma.

The hometown job would be modest. Unglamorous. Hard.

But it would be aligned.

He calls his girlfriend that night.

"I'm taking the nonprofit job."

Silence. Then: "Are you serious? You're choosing poverty over success?"

"I'm choosing myself over your version of success."

"That's not fair."

"You're right. I'm sorry. But this is my decision. And I need you to respect it even if you don't agree."

She doesn't. They break up two weeks later.

It hurts. But Liam knows: If she couldn't support him being himself, the relationship was already over.

He moves home. Takes the nonprofit job. Designs affordable housing for people who've never had a safe place to live.

The first year is hard. The pay is tight. The work is frustrating. He questions his choice a dozen times.

But he doesn't regret it.

Because when he lies down at night, he knows: He chose alignment over approval. Integrity over image.

And that—the Gītā teaches—is the only choice that leads to peace.

Five years later, his work wins a national award for community impact. The prestigious New York firm reaches out: "We saw your project. Want to join us and do this at scale?"

Liam considers it. But this time, he's not paralyzed.

Because he knows his dharma now. And he can evaluate any opportunity against it.

Does it align? Great. If not? No amount of money or status will make it right.

The decision isn't about predicting the future. It's about knowing yourself.

And then trusting that alignment will lead you where you need to go.

## Reflection

- What major decision are you avoiding? What are you waiting for—more information, or permission to choose yourself?
- When you silence everyone else's opinions, what does your own voice say? Can you hear it? Do you trust it?
- Which choice aligns with your dharma—your actual nature and values—versus which looks better on paper? Are you brave enough to choose alignment?
