# Chapter 17: Boss

## The Authority You Can't Escape

Yuki has worked for James for three years.

Three years of walking on eggshells. Three years of second-guessing every email, every presentation, every decision. Three years of feeling like she's never quite good enough, never quite meeting the standard, never quite earning his approval.

James isn't cruel. He doesn't yell. Doesn't throw things or make personal attacks.

He's just... impossible to please.

Every project she delivers gets the same response: a tight smile, a nod, and a list of what could be better. Every idea she proposes gets picked apart—not because it's bad, but because he can always find the flaw, the risk, the reason to be cautious.

And the worst part? He's often right.

He's brilliant. Strategic. Sees things she misses. His critiques make the work better.

But they also make her feel small.

This morning, she's sitting outside his office, waiting for their weekly one-on-one. Her stomach is tight. She prepared thoroughly—knows her numbers, anticipated his questions, rehearsed her updates.

But it doesn't matter. She'll still leave feeling inadequate. That's how it always goes.

His door opens. "Yuki. Come in."

She walks in. Sits down. He doesn't look up from his laptop for ten seconds. Then: "Walk me through the client retention numbers."

She does. Clearly. Concisely. Exactly as she rehearsed.

He listens. Then: "Why did we lose the Morrison account?"

She expected this. "They went with a cheaper competitor. We were 15% higher on pricing."

"And why didn't you negotiate differently?"

"I offered a discount. They said—"

"How much of a discount?"

"Ten percent."

"And they needed fifteen to match the competitor?"

"Yes."

"So you let them walk over five percent?"

Her jaw tightens. "I escalated to you. You said we don't discount more than ten percent on principle."

Silence.

Then: "Next time, bring me the options before they walk. We can always make exceptions."

She wants to scream: /You said no exceptions. You said it explicitly./

But she doesn't. She says: "Understood."

The meeting continues. Every answer she gives gets another question. Every success gets qualified. Every decision gets interrogated.

Forty minutes later, she leaves his office feeling exactly how she always feels: like she's failing, even when she's not.

And she doesn't know how much longer she can do this.

## Dealing With Difficult Authority

Most of us will work for someone difficult at some point.

Maybe they're micromanagers. Maybe they're inconsistent—praising one day, criticizing the next. Maybe they take credit for your work. Maybe they're brilliant but impossible, demanding but dismissive, right but unkind.

And the problem with difficult bosses is: you can't just quit. Or you can, but that's not always realistic. Bills need paying. Experience needs building. References matter.

So you're stuck. In a relationship you didn't fully choose, with someone who has power over you, trying to navigate their moods, their standards, their personalities while maintaining your own sanity.

The usual advice doesn't help much:

**"Just communicate better."** You've tried. They don't change.

**"Set boundaries."** How? They're your boss. They set the boundaries.

**"Focus on what you can control."** Which is what, exactly, when they control your projects, your performance review, your career trajectory?

The Bhagavad-gītā doesn't offer easy answers either. But it offers something else:

A way to work under authority you didn't choose without losing yourself in the process.

Not by changing them. Not by escaping. But by understanding the nature of authority itself—and your relationship to it.

Kṛṣṇa is Arjuna's teacher. But more than that, he's the Supreme. Ultimate authority. And Arjuna is learning how to maintain his own integrity while submitting to guidance from someone with more knowledge and power.

The teaching isn't: "Authorities are always right, so obey blindly."

The teaching is: "Learn to discern between the role and the person. Respect the position even when you disagree with the individual. And remember—your essential self is not defined by their approval or disapproval."

## The Gītā Speaks: Authority and Surrender

Arjuna's relationship with Kṛṣṇa is the model for working with authority.

At the start, Arjuna is confused, paralyzed, lost. He needs guidance. So he surrenders:

> ``Now I am confused about my duty and have lost all composure because of miserly weakness. In this condition I am asking You to tell me for certain what is best for me. Now I am Your disciple, and a soul surrendered unto You. Please instruct me.''
>
> --- Bhagavad-gītā 2.7

Surrender. But notice—it's not blind. It's conscious. Arjuna /chooses/ to listen. He recognizes that Kṛṣṇa has knowledge he lacks. So he submits to the teaching.

This is the model: When authority has genuine knowledge or legitimacy, you can submit to it without losing yourself—/if/ you understand that submission is to the role, not personal degradation.

But submission doesn't mean becoming a doormat.

Later, Arjuna questions. Challenges. Pushes back. And Kṛṣṇa /allows it/. Actually encourages it. The relationship is: teacher-student, yes. Authority-subordinate, yes. But also: dialogue, questioning, mutual respect.

Kṛṣṇa says:

> ``Just try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master. Inquire from him submissively and render service unto him. The self-realized souls can impart knowledge unto you because they have seen the truth.''
>
> --- Bhagavad-gītā 4.34

"Inquire submissively." Not "obey blindly." Inquire. Question. But do it with respect for the role.

And here's the crucial part: Even when the authority is flawed—even when James is inconsistent, demanding, impossible—the practice is the same:

Respect the position. Do your duty. But don't make your self-worth dependent on their approval.

One more verse:

> ``One who is not disturbed in mind even amidst the threefold miseries or elated when there is happiness, and who is free from attachment, fear and anger, is called a sage of steady mind.''
>
> --- Bhagavad-gītā 2.56

"Not disturbed even amidst miseries."

Working for a difficult boss is a misery. The Gītā doesn't deny that. But it says: you can be undisturbed /within/ the difficulty. Not by becoming numb. But by not attaching your essential worth to their evaluation of you.

They can criticize your work. They can't touch your soul.

## Living the Teaching: Duty Without Identification

Yuki sits in her car after the meeting.

She's shaking. Not from fear. From frustration. From the accumulated weight of three years of feeling inadequate.

And she has a choice to make.

She can quit. Start over somewhere else. Roll the dice on a new boss who might be better or might be worse.

Or she can stay. And if she stays, she needs a different way to relate to this.

She thinks about something she read in the Gītā: /You're not your role. You're not your boss's opinion of you. You're the eternal witness./

It sounds like spiritual bypassing. Like telling herself to accept abuse and call it enlightenment.

But then she realizes: James's criticism /isn't/ abuse. It's just... his personality. His standards. His way of managing.

It's not personal. Even though it feels personal.

She tries an experiment. She mentally separates:

/James the person/ (flawed, demanding, impossible to please)

/James the role/ (my boss, with legitimate authority in this organization)

/My duty/ (do good work, contribute to the team, learn what I can)

/My essential self/ (not defined by his approval, not diminished by his criticism)

When she holds these separately, something shifts.

She can respect his role without needing him to validate her worth. She can do her duty without making his approval the measure of success. She can receive his criticism as information—sometimes useful, sometimes not—without taking it as a verdict on her value as a person.

Over the following months, she practices this.

Some days it works. She presents a project, he critiques it, she doesn't spiral. She takes the useful feedback, discards the rest, moves forward.

Some days it doesn't. She leaves his office feeling small, and all the practice in the world doesn't immediately fix that.

But slowly, the dynamic changes.

Not because James changes—he doesn't. He's still demanding, still impossible to please, still brilliant and exhausting.

But Yuki changes.

She stops needing his approval. Stops making his evaluation the center of her self-worth. Stops identifying with the role of "employee trying to please difficult boss" and starts identifying with her actual self: the consciousness doing work, learning, growing, regardless of his moods.

And paradoxically, this makes her better at her job.

Because she's not spending half her energy managing his reactions or protecting her ego. She's just doing the work. Receiving feedback. Improving. Moving forward.

Without attachment to his approval.

Without fear of his criticism.

Just: doing her duty in this role, under this authority, as her contribution to the functioning of the whole.

### Practice Box

**The Practice of Working Under Difficult Authority**

1. **Separate the role from the person.** Your boss's position has legitimate authority. That doesn't mean everything they do is right. Respect the role. Question the actions when appropriate.

2. **Do your duty without attachment to approval.** Your job is to do good work. Not to make them happy. Not to earn their praise. Just to fulfill your function. Let that be enough.

3. **Receive criticism as information, not verdict.** When they critique you, ask: ``Is this feedback useful?'' If yes, use it. If no, let it go. Don't make it about your worth.

4. **Remember your essential self.** You are not your job title. Not your performance review. Not your boss's opinion. You're the eternal witness, doing work in this temporary role. They can critique your work. They can't touch your soul.

5. **Know when to leave.** If the situation is genuinely abusive or destructive, the practice isn't to endure forever. It's to maintain your integrity /while/ you plan your exit.

You can work under imperfect authority without losing yourself. That's the practice.

## The Way Forward: Authority as Teacher

A year later, Yuki is in another one-on-one with James.

Same office. Same dynamic. He still critiques everything. Still finds the flaws. Still never seems satisfied.

But she's different.

He questions a decision she made on the Chen account. And instead of defensive anxiety, she feels... curious.

"Why do you think that approach was risky?" she asks.

He explains. And she listens—not to defend herself, but to actually understand his perspective.

And she realizes: he's not wrong. He's seeing an angle she missed. His criticism is actually useful.

She says, "You're right. I didn't consider that. I'll adjust."

He looks surprised. Usually she gets defensive or shuts down.

"Good," he says. And for a brief moment, something almost like respect crosses his face.

The meeting continues. But it's different. Because she's not fighting him. Not trying to prove herself. Not needing his approval.

She's just doing her job. Receiving feedback. Learning.

And paradoxically, this is when James becomes her teacher.

Not because he's suddenly kind or easy. But because she's finally able to learn from him without needing him to be different than he is.

Six months after that, she gets an offer from another company. Better title. More money. Easier boss, probably.

She thinks about it.

The old Yuki would have jumped. Escaped. Finally gotten away from the impossible James.

But this Yuki sees something different: she's learned more in four years with James than she would have with a comfortable boss. His impossibly high standards forced her to grow. His relentless questioning taught her to think deeper. His lack of easy praise taught her to validate her own work.

He was never trying to be her mentor. But he became one anyway.

She stays. Not forever—she's not attached to staying or leaving. But for now, this is her role. Her duty. Her function.

And James, difficult as he is, is part of that.

She can work under his authority without losing herself. Can learn from him without needing him to be gentle. Can respect the role without requiring him to earn it personally.

That's freedom.

Not freedom /from/ difficult authority. But freedom /within/ it.

The authority you can't escape becomes the teacher you didn't know you needed.

## Reflection

- What are you requiring your boss to be that they're not? What would change if you stopped needing them to be different?
- Can you separate the useful criticism from the personal attack? What if all criticism is just information?
- What would it mean to do your duty without attachment to their approval—to work well because it's yours to do, not because it earns their praise?
