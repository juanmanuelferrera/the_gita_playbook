# Chapter 9: Pride

## The View From the Top

James remembers exactly when he started believing he was better.

It was subtle at first. A promotion. Then another. Awards. Recognition. People seeking his opinion, his approval, his presence. Board meetings where his word carried weight. Conferences where audiences leaned forward to catch what he said.

Somewhere in that ascent, something shifted.

He stopped seeing himself as fortunate. Started seeing himself as /superior/. Not consciously. Not in words he'd ever say aloud. But in the way he walked into rooms. The way he listened—or didn't listen—when others spoke. The way he measured people instantly: above him (rare), below him (common), worth his time (few), beneath his notice (many).

Pride isn't loud.

It doesn't announce itself. It doesn't need to. It's the quiet certainty that you're special. Different. Above. That the rules applying to others don't quite apply to you. That you've earned the right to judge, to dismiss, to be impatient with those who haven't achieved what you've achieved.

James is fifty-one. CEO of a mid-sized tech company. Married (though his wife feels more like staff lately). Two adult children who text less and less. A corner office with a view of the bay where he sits right now, reading an email that makes his jaw tighten.

The board is questioning his decision on the acquisition.

/Questioning him./

Don't they know who he is? What he's built? How many times he's been right when everyone else was wrong?

He closes the laptop harder than necessary.

Pride doesn't like being questioned. Because pride's power comes from being above question.

And right now, James is discovering what happens when that elevation starts to crack.

## The Hidden Prison

We're taught to be proud.

"Have some pride in your work." "You should be proud of yourself." "Pride comes before a fall, but hey—enjoy the rise."

And there's truth in that. There's healthy self-respect. Satisfaction in work well done. Confidence earned through competence.

But there's another kind of pride.

The kind that doesn't just appreciate your achievements—it uses them to create separation. To elevate yourself /above/ rather than simply celebrating what you've done. To build an identity around being better, smarter, more accomplished, more worthy than others.

This pride is a prison.

It looks like freedom—you're on top, after all. You have power, respect, influence. People defer to you. Your opinions matter. You matter.

But here's what pride actually does:

It isolates you. Because if you're above others, you can't truly connect with them. You can't be vulnerable, can't admit mistakes, can't ask for help. Those things threaten the elevation.

It exhausts you. Because maintaining superiority requires constant performance. You have to keep achieving, keep impressing, keep proving you belong at this level. One slip and the illusion cracks.

It makes you fragile. Because your entire sense of self rests on comparison. You're only "better" relative to others. So anyone who challenges you, surpasses you, or questions you becomes a threat to your identity itself.

And worst of all—it blinds you.

Pride can't see its own limitations. Can't learn from those it considers inferior. Can't receive wisdom from unexpected sources. Can't recognize when it's wrong because being wrong contradicts the fundamental belief: /I am above./

The Gītā calls this /ahaṅkāra/—false ego. The identification of the eternal self with temporary achievements, positions, qualities.

And it names pride as one of the doorways to self-destruction.

## The Gītā Speaks: The Disease of False Ego

Kṛṣṇa doesn't condemn confidence or competence.

He condemns the delusion that your achievements make you /essentially superior/ to others. That your temporary position in the social or professional hierarchy reflects some inherent difference in worth.

He says it directly:

> ``The bewildered spirit soul, under the influence of the three modes of material nature, thinks himself the doer of activities that are in actuality carried out by nature.''
>
> --- Bhagavad-gītā 3.27

You think you did it all yourself.

You think your intelligence, your talent, your hard work—that these are /yours/, that you created them, that they make you special.

But look closer:

Where did your intelligence come from? You didn't design your own brain. It was given to you—genetics, environment, circumstances you didn't choose.

Where did your opportunities come from? How many brilliant people never got the chance you got? How much of your success depended on timing, connections, luck—factors beyond your control?

Where does your energy to act come from? You think you're the doer, but who powers your heartbeat? Who digests your food? Who provides the oxygen, the sunlight, the gravity holding you to the earth?

/You're not the author of your abilities. You're the steward./

This doesn't mean you did nothing. You made choices. You applied effort. You developed skills.

But you did all of that /within/ a web of support, gift, and grace that you didn't create and can't control.

Kṛṣṇa continues:

> ``One who is not disturbed in mind even amidst the threefold miseries or elated when there is happiness, and who is free from attachment, fear and anger, is called a sage of steady mind.''
>
> --- Bhagavad-gītā 2.56

The sage—the one who's free—isn't elated by success.

Not because success doesn't matter. But because the sage knows: success doesn't make you /better/. It makes you someone experiencing success. Temporarily. In this moment. In this particular role.

But it doesn't change your essential nature. Doesn't elevate you above others. Doesn't mean you're the special one who deserves pride.

The same consciousness looking out through your eyes looks out through every pair of eyes. The same eternal self inhabits the CEO and the janitor, the celebrated and the forgotten, you and everyone you've ever dismissed.

Pride blinds you to that truth.

Humility reveals it.

## Living the Teaching: From Pride to Humility

James sits in his therapist's office.

He didn't want to come. Therapy is for people with problems. He has challenges, sure—doesn't everyone at his level?—but not /problems/. Not the kind that require sitting in an office talking about feelings.

But his wife gave him an ultimatum. Therapy or divorce.

So here he is.

"Tell me about your week," the therapist says.

James recounts the board meeting. The questioning. How frustrating it is to have to explain himself to people who don't understand the complexity of his decisions.

"How did that feel?" the therapist asks.

"Annoying. Like being second-guessed by people who aren't qualified to—"

He stops.

The therapist waits.

James hears what he was about to say: /people who aren't qualified to question me./

"I sound arrogant," he says quietly.

"Do you feel arrogant?"

James pauses. "I feel... like I've earned the right to be respected. To have my judgment trusted."

"And when it's not?"

"I feel... threatened."

There it is.

The crack in the armor. Pride isn't strength. It's fragility disguised as superiority.

Over the following months, James starts a practice. Simple. Humbling. Painful.

Every day, he acknowledges one thing he didn't create.

His intelligence. His education. His first break. The market conditions that favored his company's growth. The team members who made him look good. The health that let him work eighty-hour weeks. The stability he was born into.

Each acknowledgment loosens pride's grip.

He starts listening differently in meetings. Not waiting for his turn to speak. Actually listening. And discovering that people he'd dismissed have insights he'd missed.

He starts saying, "I don't know" when he doesn't know. Instead of bluffing. Instead of pretending expertise he doesn't have.

He starts asking for help. Admitting mistakes. Apologizing.

And something unexpected happens:

He becomes more effective. Not less.

Because humility doesn't mean weakness. It means accuracy. Seeing clearly what you can and can't do. Receiving wisdom from anywhere. Building real connection instead of fearful deference.

Pride isolated him. Humility connects him.

Pride exhausted him. Humility lets him rest.

Pride made him fragile. Humility makes him strong.

### Practice Box

**The Practice of Humility**

1. **Inventory what you didn't create.** Each morning, name one thing you benefit from that you didn't produce: your health, your education, your opportunities, your abilities. Let gratitude replace pride.

2. **Listen to those you've dismissed.** Find someone you've considered "beneath" you. Listen to them with full attention. Assume they have something valuable to teach you.

3. **Admit what you don't know.** Practice saying ``I don't know'' or ``I was wrong'' at least once this week. Notice what happens when you stop pretending omniscience.

4. **Acknowledge dependence.** Notice all the ways you depend on others today. The food you didn't grow. The roads you didn't build. The systems maintaining your life. You're not self-made. You're supported.

5. **Remember your humanity.** You're conscious, eternal, infinitely valuable—*and so is everyone else*. Your achievements don't make you more human. They make you a human who achieved something. For now.

Humility isn't self-hatred. It's accurate sight. Seeing what's true: you're gifted, supported, temporary, and equal.

## The Way Forward: The Freedom of Equality

Two years later, the board removes James as CEO.

It's respectful. They offer a generous severance. A board seat. Consulting opportunities. But the message is clear: it's time for new leadership.

The old James would have been destroyed.

His identity was CEO. Being CEO meant being important. Being important meant being /him/. Losing the title would have meant losing himself.

But this James—the one who's been practicing humility for two years—feels something different.

Disappointment, yes. Sadness. A sense of loss.

But not destruction.

Because he remembers what he actually is: the eternal self. The consciousness that was here before he became CEO and will be here after. The self that's no more or less valuable unemployed than employed, celebrated than forgotten, at the top than at the bottom.

At his farewell party, he gives a speech.

He thanks people. Names specific contributions. Acknowledges how much he depended on others. Admits mistakes. Celebrates what the team accomplished—not what /he/ accomplished.

And at the end, he says something that surprises everyone, including himself:

"I thought being CEO made me special. But what I've learned is that I'm exactly as valuable as every person in this room. The difference is just what role we're playing. And roles change. Thank you for letting me play this one with you."

Later, driving home, he feels light.

Not because he lost his job. But because he's lost his prison.

The pride that kept him elevated, isolated, exhausted—it's gone.

And what remains is simpler. Truer. Freer.

Just a human. No better or worse than any other. Gifted. Supported. Temporary. Equal.

And infinitely, eternally valuable—not because of what he achieved, but because of what he is.

## Reflection

- Where does pride show up in your life? What makes you feel superior to others?
- What are three things you benefit from that you didn't create?
- What would change if you saw yourself as equal to those you currently consider beneath you?
