# Chapter 46: Spirituality

## Sunday Morning

Jamal watches his grandmother dress for church.

She's ninety-two. Moves slowly. But every Sunday, without fail, she's ready by 8 AM.

"Grandma, you don't have to go if you're tired," he says.

She looks at him like he's spoken nonsense. "Baby, this isn't about tired. This is about feeding my soul."

Jamal nods. Doesn't argue.

But he doesn't understand.

He stopped going to church at sixteen. Stopped believing at nineteen. Now, at thirty-four, he considers himself spiritual but not religious.

Which, he's realizing, might mean nothing at all.

He meditates sometimes. Reads books about mindfulness. Listens to podcasts about consciousness. Believes in "something bigger."

But what does that actually mean?

His grandmother has a practice. A community. A tradition that shapes her life.

Jamal has thoughts. Ideas. Vibes.

Is that spirituality? Or is it just consumption dressed up as seeking?

## Reflective Bridge

We live in the age of spiritual tourism.

Sample Buddhism here. Try yoga there. A bit of Stoicism. Some mindfulness. A podcast on transcendence. A retreat on awakening.

Collect it all. Synthesize nothing.

It feels like seeking. Like being open. Like staying curious.

But maybe it's just avoidance. Avoidance of commitment. Of discipline. Of actually submitting to a path that might demand something uncomfortable.

Jamal has attended workshops on chakras, breathwork, manifestation, energy healing. He's read the Tao Te Ching, the Dhammapada, the Yoga Sutras.

But he's never committed to any of it long enough to let it change him.

His grandmother, meanwhile, has practiced one thing -- Christian devotion -- for seventy-five years.

Simple. Consistent. Transformative.

Jamal has more spiritual knowledge in his podcast app than she's encountered in her lifetime.

But she has something he doesn't: actual spiritual life.

Not ideas about God. Relationship with God.

Not theories about love. Embodied love.

Spirituality isn't what you know. It's how you live.

## The Gita Speaks: The Anatomy of Devotion

The Bhagavad-gita doesn't offer spirituality as a menu. It offers it as a marriage. You choose a path. You commit. You practice. You transform.

And Krishna describes that commitment from every angle -- why God descends, what devotion looks like, and where it leads.

> "Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bharata, and a predominant rise of irreligion -- at that time I descend Myself."
>
> -- Bhagavad-gita 4.7

**I descend Myself.** God doesn't send a memo. He comes personally. Spirituality isn't a human invention reaching upward. It's a divine response reaching down.

Jamal has been reaching upward -- sampling, seeking, browsing. But he's never considered that something might be reaching toward him.

> "And of all yogis, he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in transcendental loving service, is most intimately united with Me in yoga and is the highest of all."
>
> -- Bhagavad-gita 6.47

**Great faith.** Not tentative curiosity. Not intellectual interest. Faith -- deep trust that leads to commitment.

**Most intimately united.** The highest spiritual attainment isn't having the most knowledge. It's having the deepest relationship.

Jamal's grandmother doesn't know Sanskrit. Can't explain yoga philosophy. But she abides. With great faith. Daily. That's what makes her a yogi -- though she'd never use the word.

> "After many births and deaths, he who is actually in knowledge surrenders unto Me, knowing Me to be the cause of all causes and all that is. Such a great soul is very rare."
>
> -- Bhagavad-gita 7.19

**After many births and deaths.** This isn't casual. It takes lifetimes. Real surrender isn't easy -- it's the culmination of a long journey.

**Such a great soul is very rare.** Most people will browse forever. The one who actually surrenders -- actually commits -- is rare.

Then Krishna reveals what committed spirituality looks like in practice:

> "If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, fruit or water, I will accept it."
>
> -- Bhagavad-gita 9.26

**A leaf, a flower, fruit or water.** Not elaborate rituals. Not expensive offerings. The simplest things, offered with love. That's what God accepts.

Jamal's grandmother puts a plate of food on her altar every morning. Simple. Nothing fancy. But offered with love. And according to Krishna, that's enough.

> "O son of Kunti, all that you do, all that you eat, all that you offer and give away, as well as all austerities that you may perform, should be done as an offering unto Me."
>
> -- Bhagavad-gita 9.27

**All that you do.** Not just the "spiritual" parts. Everything. Work. Meals. Conversations. Rest. All of it becomes spiritual when offered.

> "Engage your mind always in thinking of Me, offer obeisances and worship Me. Being completely absorbed in Me, surely you will come to Me."
>
> -- Bhagavad-gita 9.34/18.65

**Surely you will come to Me.** The promise is absolute. Not "you might." Surely. The only condition is absorption -- thinking of God, worshiping God, living for God.

And how do devoted souls actually live?

> "The thoughts of My pure devotees dwell in Me, their lives are surrendered to Me, and they derive great satisfaction and bliss enlightening one another and conversing about Me."
>
> -- Bhagavad-gita 10.9

**Enlightening one another and conversing about Me.** This is community. Fellowship. Spiritual life isn't solo. It's shared. Jamal's grandmother does this every Sunday -- she converses, she sings, she prays with others. That's the life Krishna describes.

> "My dear Arjuna, one who is engaged in My pure devotional service, free from the contaminations of previous activities and from mental speculation, who is friendly to every living entity, certainly comes to Me."
>
> -- Bhagavad-gita 11.55

**Free from mental speculation.** Not endless theorizing. Practice. Devotion. Action.

**Friendly to every living entity.** Real spirituality makes you kinder. If it doesn't, something is wrong.

And the culmination:

> "One who is thus transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman."
>
> -- Bhagavad-gita 18.54

> "Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reaction. Do not fear."
>
> -- Bhagavad-gita 18.66

**Abandon all varieties.** Stop browsing. Choose. Surrender. Let one path carry you all the way.

**Do not fear.** The fear of commitment, the fear of being wrong, the fear of missing something better -- Krishna addresses it directly. Do not fear. Surrender, and be delivered.

## Living the Teaching

Jamal picks up his grandmother from church.

"How was service?" he asks.

"Powerful," she says. "Pastor spoke on forgiveness. Really convicted me about holding grudges."

"You? You don't hold grudges."

"Oh baby, I do," she laughs. "I've been mad at Sister Patricia for three years. Today, I realized I need to let it go."

"So you will?"

"Already did. Called her during fellowship hour. We cried. We prayed. It's done."

Jamal marvels at this. The speed. The directness. The transformation.

"How do you do that?" he asks.

She looks at him. "That's what spirituality is, baby. Not thinking about it. Doing it."

"But what if you don't know what to do?"

"Then you ask God. You read the Word. You talk to your community. You pray. And then you act. You don't need to figure it all out first. You just need to take the next faithful step."

Jamal thinks about his bookshelf. His podcast queue. His endless reading list. All those paths. None chosen.

"Grandma," he says quietly, "I think I'm lost."

She pats his hand. "You're not lost, baby. You're just standing at the crossroads trying to walk every direction at once. Pick one. Walk it. God will meet you there."

### Practice Box

**The Practice of Committed Spirituality**

**1. Choose your path.** Study broadly if you must. But commit deeply to one tradition, one practice, one relationship with the Divine. Depth beats breadth.

**2. Offer simply.** A leaf, a flower, fruit, or water. You don't need elaborate rituals. Offer what you have -- with love.

**3. Make everything an offering.** All that you do, all that you eat -- let it become an act of devotion. Spirituality isn't a compartment. It's the whole life.

**4. Find your community.** The Gita describes devotees enlightening one another. Find people walking your path. Learn from them. Serve with them.

## The Way Forward

Jamal starts going to church with his grandmother.

Not because he suddenly believes everything she believes. But because he needs to stop browsing and start practicing.

The first few weeks are uncomfortable. The theology doesn't all fit. Some of the music feels outdated. The rituals seem strange.

But he stays.

And slowly, something shifts. Not his beliefs, necessarily. His being.

There's something about showing up. About singing with others. About hearing ancient words read aloud. About praying for people who need help.

It's not intellectual. It's participatory.

He's not studying spirituality anymore. He's living it.

One Sunday, after service, an older man approaches him. "You're Mama Joyce's grandson, right?"

"Yes sir."

"She's been praying for you to come back to church for years. Every prayer meeting. 'Lord, bring my Jamal home.' Well, here you are."

Jamal looks across the room at his grandmother. She's talking to Sister Patricia. Both of them laughing.

She lived her spirituality. Prayed. Loved. Forgave. Served.

While he collected ideas, she embodied truth.

While he browsed paths, she walked one.

While he sought spirituality, she was spiritual.

And her life -- her actual, lived, embodied life -- was the sermon that finally reached him.

A year later, a friend asks, "So you're Christian now?"

Jamal thinks about it. "I'm learning to be. I'm practicing. Not perfectly. But consistently."

"What changed?"

"I stopped collecting spirituality and started living it. Chose a path. Found a community. Made a practice. And it's transforming me in ways reading never did."

Because spirituality isn't a concept. It's a commitment.

You don't think your way into it. You practice your way into it.

And one day, you realize: you're not seeking anymore. You've found.

Not all the answers. But the path.

And the path -- walked faithfully, daily, humbly -- is enough.

## Reflection

- Are you collecting spiritual ideas or committing to spiritual practice? What paths have you sampled without ever walking deeply?
- Krishna says to offer even a leaf or flower with love. What simple, daily offering could you begin -- not elaborate, just sincere?
- Is your spirituality changing how you live, or just how you think? What would embodied spirituality look like for you -- today, right now?
