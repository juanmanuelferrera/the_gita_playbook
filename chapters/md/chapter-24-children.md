# Chapter 24: Children

## The Report Card

Grace sits across from her daughter at the kitchen table, staring at the progress report.

Three Cs. Two Bs. Not a single A.

Emma is twelve. Smart -- Grace knows she is smart. But lately, it is like she does not care. Homework rushed or forgotten. Projects done at the last minute. And now this.

"Emma," Grace says, keeping her voice level. "We need to talk about your grades."

Emma does not look up from her phone.

"Emma."

"What?" The eye roll is practically audible.

"Put the phone down."

Emma sighs dramatically, sets the phone on the table face-down. Still does not make eye contact.

Grace feels the familiar frustration rising. When did her sweet, curious daughter turn into this sullen stranger?

"These grades aren't acceptable. You're capable of much better than this."

"Maybe I don't care about grades."

"Well, you should care. Your future depends on --"

"My future? Or yours?"

The words land like a slap.

Grace opens her mouth. Closes it. Tries again. "What's that supposed to mean?"

"Nothing. Can I go?"

"No, you can't go. We're not done talking about this."

"You mean you're not done lecturing me about this."

And there it is -- the contempt, the distance, the wall Grace cannot break through.

She loves this child more than her own life. Would do anything for her. Has sacrificed everything to give her opportunities Grace never had.

And Emma treats her like the enemy.

## Loving Without Controlling

Raising children might be the hardest thing we do.

Not because of the sleepless nights or the financial strain -- though those are real. But because we have to love someone completely while accepting we cannot control their path.

We want them to be happy. Successful. Safe. To make good choices, avoid our mistakes, fulfill their potential.

And when they do not -- when they rebel, struggle, choose differently than we would -- it feels like failure. Ours.

Grace has poured everything into Emma. Private school. Music lessons. Tutors. Every advantage she could provide.

But Emma does not want advantages. She wants to be left alone.

And Grace cannot understand it. Does she not see I am doing this for her? That I only want what is best?

But here is the question the Gita forces us to ask: Whose "best" are we talking about?

Grace wants Emma to excel academically, get into a good college, build a secure future. That is what Grace values. That is the path that makes sense to Grace.

But is it Emma's path?

Or is Grace trying to sculpt her daughter into the person Grace thinks she should be?

This is the parent's dilemma: the line between guiding and controlling is razor-thin. And we cross it every day without realizing.

Because we love them. And love makes us blind to where we end and they begin.

## The Gita Speaks: The Divine Parent

The Gita speaks about children from an extraordinary angle -- not from the parent looking down, but from the divine looking at all creation with the eyes of a parent who sustains without possessing.

Krishna reveals how the ultimate parent relates to all beings:

> "I am the father of this universe, the mother, the sustainer and the grandfather. I am the object of knowledge, the purifier and the syllable om."
>
> --- Bhagavad-gita 9.17

Father. Mother. Sustainer. Grandfather. Krishna claims every parental role simultaneously -- and yet look at how this divine parent operates:

> "And yet all that is created does not rest in Me. Therein lies My mystical opulence! Although I am the sustainer of all living entities and although I am everywhere, I am not part of this cosmic manifestation, for My Being is the very source of creation."
>
> --- Bhagavad-gita 9.5

This is the paradox Grace needs to understand. The divine sustains all living entities, is everywhere, is the source of creation -- and yet does not absorb creation into itself. All that is created does not rest in Me. The parent who sustains everything is simultaneously not entangled with everything.

This is not neglect. It is mystical opulence. The highest form of parenting is sustaining without possessing. Being the source without being the cage.

Grace sustains Emma -- feeds her, shelters her, provides for her. But she has also tried to make Emma rest in her -- in her values, her ambitions, her vision of the future. And the Gita says: that is not how the divine parent works. The source gives life and then lets life unfold.

Arjuna himself recognizes this quality in Krishna:

> "You are the father of all this cosmic manifestation, of the mobile and the immobile. Thou art its revered chief, the supreme spiritual master."
>
> --- Bhagavad-gita 11.43

The father of all cosmic manifestation does not micromanage the cosmos. He does not insist the planets orbit according to his personal preference. He does not punish the rivers for flowing in directions he did not plan. He is the revered chief -- and his authority comes precisely from the freedom he grants.

Grace wants to be revered by Emma. Respected. Listened to. But reverence cannot be demanded. It is earned by the kind of authority that liberates rather than controls.

The Gita then reveals what true seeing looks like in relationships:

> "O Arjuna, he who, by comparison with his own self, sees the true equality of all beings in their happiness as well as in their affliction, is a perfect yogi."
>
> --- Bhagavad-gita 6.32

By comparison with his own self. Grace needs to remember what it felt like to be twelve. The confusion. The desire for autonomy. The resentment of being told who to be. If she compares Emma's affliction with her own -- if she sees the equality of their struggle -- she stops being the authority figure and becomes the companion.

And finally, the Gita offers the sobering wisdom about what true knowledge requires:

> "Perception of the bad of birth, death, old age and disease; being free from the entanglement of children, wife, home and so forth; equanimity in the midst of pleasant and unpleasant events."
>
> --- Bhagavad-gita 13.9

Being free from the entanglement of children. Not free from children. Free from entanglement. The Gita does not say abandon your children. It says stop being entangled -- stop wrapping your identity, your worth, your emotional stability around their choices.

Grace's mood rises and falls with Emma's grades. Her sense of success as a parent depends on Emma's compliance. That is entanglement. And the Gita calls freedom from it a mark of genuine knowledge.

## Living the Teaching

So what does Grace do?

Give up? Stop caring? Let Emma fail?

No. She needs to learn the hardest practice of all:

### Practice Box

**The Practice of Sustaining Without Possessing**

1. **Be the source, not the cage.** Sustain your child -- provide, protect, guide. But do not absorb them into your vision. All that is created does not rest in the creator. Your child's life is not your project. It is their unfolding.

2. **Compare with your own self.** Remember what it felt like to be their age. Remember your own confusion, your own desire for autonomy, your own resentment of being controlled. See the equality of your struggles. Compassion replaces control.

3. **Disentangle your identity.** Your worth as a parent is not measured by their grades, their compliance, or their gratitude. Free yourself from that entanglement. Equanimity in pleasant and unpleasant events -- including the unpleasant event of a report card full of Cs.

4. **Earn reverence through freedom.** The supreme spiritual master is revered because of the liberty he grants, not the obedience he demands. Authority that liberates creates respect. Authority that controls creates rebellion.

## The Way Forward

Two days later, Grace tries again.

Not with the report card. Not with lectures. With a question.

She finds Emma in her room, headphones on, sketching in a notebook.

Grace knocks on the open door. Emma looks up, wary.

"Can I come in?"

Emma shrugs. Grace sits on the edge of the bed.

"What are you drawing?"

Another shrug. But Emma turns the notebook slightly so Grace can see. A character design -- a fantasy warrior, intricate armor, dynamic pose.

"That's amazing," Grace says. And means it.

"It's just doodling."

"No," Grace says quietly. "It's not. You have real talent."

Emma glances at her, suspicious. Waiting for the "but."

Grace takes a breath. "I owe you an apology."

Now Emma is really suspicious.

"I've been pushing you to be the student I think you should be. But I haven't asked what you want. What you're actually interested in."

"You wouldn't care."

"Try me."

Silence. Then, quietly: "I want to study art. Character design for games and animation."

"Okay."

"Okay? That's it? No lecture about how I need good grades to get into college? No 'art isn't a real career'?"

Grace feels the old arguments rising. The fear. What if she cannot make a living? What if she regrets it?

But she swallows them.

"You're right," she says. "I probably would have said those things last week. But I'm trying to do better."

"Why?"

"Because you're not me. And I need to stop trying to make you rest in my plans for you."

Emma's eyes fill with tears. "You never trust me."

"I know," Grace says. "And I'm sorry. I've been so afraid of you failing that I forgot to see who you actually are."

They sit in silence for a moment.

Then Emma says, voice small: "I know my grades suck. I just... I can't care about algebra when all I want to do is draw."

"So draw," Grace says. "And we'll figure out the rest together. But you can't just fail everything. Can we agree on that?"

Emma nods. "I'll try harder. If you promise to stop treating me like your project."

"Deal."

It is not fixed. The tension does not disappear. Emma's grades do not magically improve.

But something shifts.

Grace stops trying to control the outcome. Starts trying to support the person Emma actually is -- not the one Grace imagined.

And slowly -- very slowly -- the wall between them begins to crack.

Because Grace finally understood: her duty is to sustain, to guide, to be the source.

Not to possess. Not to entangle. Not to own.

The father of the cosmos does not insist creation follow his personal preferences. He sustains. He liberates. And he is revered for it.

Grace is learning to do the same.

## Reflection

- Where are you trying to make your child "rest in you" -- absorbing their life into your vision rather than letting them unfold on their own path?
- Can you compare your child's struggle with your own at that age? What does equality of experience reveal about what they actually need from you?
- What would it look like to sustain without possessing -- to be the source of support without being the cage of expectation?
