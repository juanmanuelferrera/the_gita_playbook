# Chapter 24: Children

## The Report Card

Grace sits across from her daughter at the kitchen table, staring at the progress report.

Three Cs. Two Bs. Not a single A.

Emma is twelve. Smart—Grace knows she's smart. But lately, it's like she doesn't care. Homework rushed or forgotten. Projects done at the last minute. And now this.

"Emma," Grace says, keeping her voice level. "We need to talk about your grades."

Emma doesn't look up from her phone.

"Emma."

"What?" The eye roll is practically audible.

"Put the phone down."

Emma sighs dramatically, sets the phone on the table face-down. Still doesn't make eye contact.

Grace feels the familiar frustration rising. When did her sweet, curious daughter turn into this sullen stranger?

"These grades aren't acceptable. You're capable of much better than this."

"Maybe I don't care about grades."

"Well, you should care. Your future depends on—"

"My future? Or yours?"

The words land like a slap.

Grace opens her mouth. Closes it. Tries again. "What's that supposed to mean?"

"Nothing. Can I go?"

"No, you can't go. We're not done talking about this."

"You mean you're not done /lecturing/ me about this."

And there it is—the contempt, the distance, the wall Grace can't seem to break through.

She loves this child more than her own life. Would do anything for her. Has sacrificed everything to give her opportunities Grace never had.

And Emma treats her like the enemy.

## Loving Without Controlling

Raising children might be the hardest thing we do.

Not because of the sleepless nights or the financial strain—though those are real. But because we have to love someone completely while accepting we can't control their path.

We want them to be happy. Successful. Safe. To make good choices, avoid our mistakes, fulfill their potential.

And when they don't—when they rebel, struggle, choose differently than we would—it feels like failure. Ours.

Grace has poured everything into Emma. Private school. Music lessons. Tutors. Every advantage she could provide.

But Emma doesn't want advantages. She wants to be left alone.

And Grace can't understand it. *Doesn't she see I'm doing this for her? That I only want what's best?*

But here's the question the Gītā forces us to ask:

Whose "best" are we talking about?

Grace wants Emma to excel academically, get into a good college, build a secure future. That's what Grace values. That's the path that makes sense to Grace.

But is it Emma's path?

Or is Grace trying to sculpt her daughter into the person Grace thinks she should be?

This is the parent's dilemma: The line between guiding and controlling is razor-thin. And we cross it every day without realizing.

Because we love them. And love makes us blind to where we end and they begin.

## The Gītā Speaks: Detached Devotion

The Gītā has something radical to say about children—though it doesn't say it directly. It's buried in the teaching about action without attachment to results:

> ``You have a right to perform your prescribed duty, but you are not entitled to the fruits of action. Never consider yourself to be the cause of the results of your activities.''
>
> --- Bhagavad-gītā 2.47

Applied to parenting, this means:

Your duty is to guide, teach, provide, protect—to do the work of parenting with love and skill.

But the results—who your child becomes, what choices they make, where their path leads—those aren't yours to control.

You're not entitled to the fruits.

This doesn't mean you don't care. It means you care deeply—but you release your grip on the outcome.

Because here's the truth Grace is struggling to accept: Emma is not an extension of Grace. She's her own soul, on her own journey.

And the Gītā makes this explicit:

> ``As the embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death. The self-realized soul is not bewildered by such a change.''
>
> --- Bhagavad-gītā 2.13

Your child is an eternal soul, temporarily in your care. You didn't create them—you're stewarding them through one phase of their infinite existence.

They came into this world with their own nature, their own karma, their own /dharma/ to fulfill.

Your job isn't to mold them into your image. It's to help them discover theirs.

And then Kṛṣṇa says something that shatters every parental fantasy of control:

> ``It is far better to perform one's own prescribed duty, even though it may be of lesser quality, than to do another's duty perfectly.''
>
> --- Bhagavad-gītā 3.35

Even if you could make your child perfect according to your standards—even if you could force them to follow the path you've chosen—it would be worse for them than stumbling along their own path.

Because it's not their duty. It's yours.

And forcing them to live your unlived dreams is a form of violence, no matter how loving it feels.

## Living the Teaching: The Parent's Release

So what does Grace do?

Give up? Stop caring? Let Emma fail?

No.

She needs to learn the hardest practice of all:

### Practice Box

**The Detached Love Practice**

**1. Distinguish your fear from their path.**
Ask: ``Am I pushing this because it's truly what my child needs? Or because I'm afraid of what will happen if they don't do it my way?'' Fear masquerades as wisdom.

**2. Perform your duty without controlling the outcome.**
Your duty: provide guidance, create safe boundaries, offer opportunities. Not your duty: ensure they use those opportunities the way you would.

**3. See the soul, not the role.**
Your child is not ``my daughter who's failing.'' They're an eternal being having an experience. Can you honor that without needing to fix it?

**4. Offer, don't impose.**
Share your wisdom. Provide resources. Then step back. If they reject your help, that's their right. You've done your duty.

This is brutal work.

Because it means accepting that you might watch your child struggle, make mistakes, suffer—and your job is to be present, not to rescue.

Grace wants to control Emma's future to protect her. But control isn't protection. It's imprisonment.

Real protection is teaching Emma to navigate her own path. Even when that path looks nothing like the one Grace would choose.

## The Way Forward: Letting Go

Two days later, Grace tries again.

Not with the report card. Not with lectures. With a question.

She finds Emma in her room, headphones on, sketching in a notebook.

Grace knocks on the open door. Emma looks up, wary.

"Can I come in?"

Emma shrugs. Grace sits on the edge of the bed.

"What are you drawing?"

Another shrug. But Emma turns the notebook slightly so Grace can see. A character design—some kind of fantasy warrior, intricate armor, dynamic pose.

"That's amazing," Grace says. And means it.

"It's just doodling."

"No," Grace says quietly. "It's not. You have real talent."

Emma glances at her, suspicious. Waiting for the "but."

Grace takes a breath. "I owe you an apology."

Now Emma's really suspicious.

"I've been pushing you to be the student I think you should be. But I haven't asked what /you/ want. What you're actually interested in."

"You wouldn't care."

"Try me."

Silence. Then, quietly: "I want to study art. Character design for games and animation."

"Okay."

"Okay? That's it? No lecture about how I need good grades to get into college? No 'art isn't a real career'?"

Grace feels the old arguments rising. The fear. *What if she can't make a living? What if she regrets it?*

But she swallows them.

"You're right," she says. "I probably would have said those things last week. But I'm trying to do better."

"Why?"

"Because you're not me. And I need to trust that you know your own path better than I do."

Emma's eyes fill with tears. "You never trust me."

"I know," Grace says. "And I'm sorry. I've been so afraid of you failing that I forgot to see who you actually are."

They sit in silence for a moment.

Then Emma says, voice small: "I know my grades suck. I just... I can't care about algebra when all I want to do is draw."

"So draw," Grace says. "And we'll figure out the rest together. But you can't just fail everything. Can we agree on that?"

Emma nods. "I'll try harder. If you promise to stop treating me like your project."

"Deal."

It's not fixed. The tension doesn't disappear. Emma's grades don't magically improve.

But something shifts.

Grace stops trying to control the outcome. Starts trying to support the person Emma actually is, not the one Grace imagined.

And slowly—very slowly—the wall between them begins to crack.

Because Grace finally understood: Her duty is to love, guide, and release.

Not to own.

## Reflection

- Where are you trying to control your child's path instead of supporting their own journey? What fear is driving that control?
- Can you see your child as an independent soul rather than an extension of yourself? What would change if you truly believed they have their own dharma to fulfill?
- What would it look like to perform your duty as a parent without attachment to who they become? Can you love them as they are, not as you need them to be?
