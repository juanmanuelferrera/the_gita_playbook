# Light of Dharma Writing & Style Guide

## Mission & Voice

We write to illuminate, not condemn. Our articles expose problems within spiritual institutions while maintaining deep respect for sincere practitioners and the philosophical tradition itself. We challenge systems and ideas, not individuals. Our voice is that of a concerned friend who cares enough to tell difficult truths.

Do not forget "description" en el front matter

## The Outlining Process: From Idea to Structure

**Before you write a single sentence, develop your outline.** This is the foundation that will keep your article focused, compelling, and effective.

### Step 1: Capture the Core Idea

Start by articulating the central insight in 1-2 sentences:
- What pattern/problem are you exposing?
- Why does it matter to practitioners right now?
- What truth needs to be told?

**Example:** "People use 'surrender' language to justify giving up on difficult spiritual practices, mistaking resignation for devotion. This pseudo-surrender creates stagnation while maintaining the appearance of advancement."

### Step 2: Build Your Structural Skeleton

The following 8 elements represent the **maximum structure** for comprehensive articles (see "Structure for Clarity" section below for details):

1. Opening narrative with a specific person
2. Clear definition of the problem
3. Multiple concrete scenarios showing how it manifests
4. Explanation of the underlying psychology/mechanics
5. Scriptural/traditional grounding with verse references
6. Demonstration of real-world consequences
7. Presentation of the authentic alternative
8. Practical way forward with hope

**However:** Not every article requires all 8 elements. Shorter, more focused pieces can work with a streamlined structure. You might combine sections (psychology + consequences), skip the scenarios section if the opening narrative is sufficient, or merge the alternative with the way forward.

**The non-negotiables are:**
- Opening with a concrete story or vivid example (not abstract theory)
- Clear problem definition
- Scriptural/traditional grounding
- Practical way forward

Use your judgment: a 1,500-word article might need 4-5 sections, while a 3,000-word deep dive benefits from the full 8-part structure.

### Step 3: Name Your Sections Creatively

**This is crucial:** While the *structure* must follow the proven architecture, the *section titles* should be fresh, provocative, and specific to your topic.

**Avoid formulaic headers like:**
- "What Is It?"
- "How It Plays Out"
- "The Psychology Behind It"

**Instead, craft evocative titles that intrigue and orient:**

**For "The Surrender Trap":**
- Opening narrative: (no header—just start)
- Definition section: "The Seduction of False Surrender"
- Scenarios section: "How the Trap Springs"
- Psychology section: "Why We Fall For It"
- Scripture section: "What Surrender Actually Means"
- Consequences section: "The High Cost"
- Alternative section: "What Real Surrender Looks Like"
- Action section: "The Way Forward"

**For a hypothetical article on guru abuse:**
- Opening narrative: (no header)
- Definition: "The Authority Distortion"
- Scenarios: "Five Ways It Manifests"
- Psychology: "The Mechanics of Spiritual Dependency"
- Scripture: "What the Parampara Actually Teaches"
- Consequences: "When Guidance Becomes Control"
- Alternative: "Authentic Guru-Disciple Relationships"
- Action: "Reclaiming Your Spiritual Agency"

**The principle:** Your reader should be able to scan your table of contents and feel *pulled in*, not like they're reading a academic template.

### Step 4: Populate Each Section

Once you have your creatively-named sections, fill in the outline with:
- Key points to cover (bullet points)
- Specific scenarios/examples to include
- Relevant verse references (with numbers)
- Transitions between sections
- The emotional arc you want to create

**Example outline snippet:**

```
## The Mechanics of Spiritual Bypass
- Why difficulty triggers flight response
- Cultural conditioning around "positive thinking"
- ISKCON's particular vulnerability to this pattern
  * High ideals + struggling practitioners = perfect storm
  * Quote BG 2.47 on action without attachment to results
- The brain's preference for immediate relief
- Transition: These psychological factors create predictable scenarios...
```

### Step 5: Ensure Variety Across Articles

As you build your content library, track your section naming patterns:
- Don't use "The High Cost" in every article
- Vary between questions and statements
- Mix metaphorical and literal language
- Some sections can be punchy (3-4 words), others more descriptive

**This prevents your body of work from feeling repetitive, even though the underlying structure is consistent.**

## Core Principles

### 1. Lead with Empathy
- Always demonstrate understanding of *why* people adopt problematic patterns
- Acknowledge the genuine spiritual aspirations that lead to mistakes
- Never mock or belittle those caught in the patterns we critique
- Show compassion for the difficulty of spiritual practice

**Example from "The Surrender Trap":**
> "The trap is seductive precisely because it uses the language of devotion. It sounds humble. It appears to demonstrate faith."

### 2. Make It Personal and Concrete
- Begin with vivid, detailed narratives about specific people
- Use names, emotions, and sensory details to create connection
- Show the human cost of abstract problems
- Let readers see themselves in the stories

**Not this:** "Many practitioners abandon their commitments when faced with difficulty."

**But this:** "Ananda arrived at the temple with the kind of enthusiasm that lights up a room... He stopped sleeping well. He started dreading Sundays."

### 3. Structure for Clarity
Every major article should follow this proven architecture:

1. **Opening Narrative** (300-500 words)
   - Introduce a specific person facing a specific challenge
   - Build emotional investment before presenting concepts
   - End the narrative with the problematic resolution

2. **What Is It?** Section
   - Define the problem clearly
   - Explain why it's seductive/common
   - Connect to broader patterns

3. **How It Plays Out** Section
   - Provide 3-5 concrete scenarios
   - Show diversity of manifestations (individual, institutional, doctrinal)
   - Use subheadings for each scenario

4. **The Psychology/Mechanics** Section
   - Explain *why* this happens
   - Break down the underlying factors
   - Show the thought patterns involved

5. **The Scriptural/Traditional Response** Section
   - Present what the tradition actually teaches
   - Include specific verse references with numbers
   - Show the contrast with the distortion
   - Use historical examples (Prabhupada, etc.)

6. **The High Cost** Section
   - Demonstrate real-world consequences
   - Show cascading effects (personal → institutional → cultural)
   - Make the stakes clear

7. **What Real [X] Looks Like** Section
   - Provide the authentic alternative
   - Show what right practice actually entails
   - Use vivid metaphors and analogies

8. **The Way Forward** Section
   - Offer practical, actionable steps
   - End on hope and possibility
   - Invite re-engagement, not guilt

## Writing Style

### Tone: Firm Compassion
- **Challenging without condemning:** "You haven't failed spiritually. You've made a philosophical error, and errors can be corrected."
- **Direct without harshness:** Call out problems clearly, but always show understanding of how people got there
- **Urgent without panicking:** Convey seriousness while maintaining measured analysis

### Language Choices

**Use:**
- Active voice: "The surrender trap catches its prey" not "Prey is caught by the surrender trap"
- Concrete nouns: "temple," "practitioner," "morning chanting" over abstractions
- Vivid verbs: "collapsed," "metastasize," "crushes" not "happened," "spread," "affects"
- Second person for direct engagement: "If you recognize yourself in these patterns..."
- Rhetorical questions sparingly: "So what's the alternative?"

**Avoid:**
- Academic jargon without explanation
- Passive constructions that obscure agency
- Excessive Sanskrit without translation/context
- Moralizing or preaching tone
- Us vs. them framing

### Sentence Structure
- **Vary length:** Mix short punchy sentences with longer analytical ones
- **Use fragments for emphasis:** "Not to accept. Not to resign. Not to conclude... To *fight*."
- **Employ parallelism:** "Fear of failure. Fear of prolonged discomfort. Fear of discovering..."
- **Build rhythm:** Create momentum through repetition and structure

### Paragraph Construction
- **Open strong:** First sentence should hook and orient
- **Develop one idea:** Each paragraph focuses on a single concept
- **End with impact:** Final sentence should drive the point home or transition smoothly
- **Optimal length:** 3-5 sentences for body paragraphs, shorter for emphasis

## Scripture Integration

### When to Quote
- To establish authoritative basis for claims
- To contrast authentic teaching with distortion
- To provide actionable wisdom
- To give weight to difficult truths

### How to Quote
1. **Always include verse numbers:** "Bhagavad-gita 2.47"
2. **Provide context:** Brief setup before the verse
3. **Explain significance:** Don't assume readers grasp the application
4. **Integrate naturally:** Verses should flow within the argument, not feel dropped in

**Example:**
> "The verses are explicit:
>
> **Bhagavad-gita 2.47** states: 'You have a right to perform your prescribed duties, but you are not entitled to the fruits of your actions...'
>
> This verse is the philosophical antidote to the surrender trap. Notice what it commands: Perform your duty. What it prohibits: Attachment to the results *and attachment to inaction*."

## Storytelling Techniques

### Character Development
- Give characters names (Ananda, Maya, Raghunath, Bhakta David)
- Include specific details: "seventy years old with forty rupees"
- Show internal thought processes: "And he almost believed it"
- Track emotional progression: enthusiasm → struggle → false relief

### Scenario Construction
Each scenario should include:
1. **Setup:** Who is this person? What's their role/practice?
2. **Challenge:** What specific difficulty do they face?
3. **Problematic Response:** How do they misapply the principle?
4. **Consequence:** What's the real-world result?

### Pacing
- **Slow down for stories:** Give scenes room to breathe
- **Speed up for analysis:** Move crisply through conceptual points
- **Accelerate toward consequences:** Build urgency when showing damage
- **Decelerate for solutions:** Give readers space to absorb alternatives

## Empathy Markers

Throughout the article, include phrases that demonstrate understanding:
- "This is emotionally safer than..."
- "It's spiritually illiterate interpretation masquerading as advanced realization"
- "If you recognize yourself in these patterns, understand this: You haven't failed spiritually"
- "The person caught in it can feel spiritually elevated"

These show we understand the *appeal* of the mistake, not just its error.

## Key Formatting

### Headers
- **H2 (##) for major sections:** "What Is It?" "The Way Forward"
- **H3 (###) for subsections:** Used sparingly within major sections
- **Bold for scenario names:** "**The Wavering Practitioner:**"

### Emphasis
- *Italics* for key terms or emphasis: "*act*", "*why*"
- **Bold** for critical distinctions: "**maximal effort and complete acceptance**"
- Use sparingly—over-emphasis dilutes impact

### Lists
- Use when presenting multiple factors/scenarios/steps
- Keep parallel structure (all start with nouns, or all with verbs)
- Each item should be substantive, not just a word

### Block Quotes
- Reserve for extended quotations
- Use sparingly in philosophical analysis
- More common in investigative/textual articles

## Article Length & Depth

**Target length:** 2,000-3,500 words
- Shorter pieces lack the depth needed for transformation
- Longer pieces risk losing reader attention
- The sweet spot allows for story + analysis + solution

**Depth requirements:**
- Surface level: Identify the problem
- Mid-level: Explain psychology and mechanics
- Deep level: Provide scriptural/traditional grounding
- Practical level: Offer concrete way forward

## The "Helper's Heart"

Every article should embody these commitments:

1. **We've been there:** Write as someone who understands these struggles firsthand
2. **We want you to succeed:** Genuine desire for reader's spiritual growth
3. **We respect the struggle:** Acknowledge that spiritual practice is genuinely difficult
4. **We offer truth, not comfort:** Sometimes love means saying hard things
5. **We provide paths forward:** Never diagnose without offering remedy

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Preaching from superiority:** Never position yourself above the reader
❌ **Analysis without story:** Don't lead with abstract concepts
❌ **Condemnation without compassion:** Don't forget why people make these mistakes
❌ **Problems without solutions:** Always provide the way forward
❌ **Excessive jargon:** Make philosophy accessible
❌ **Attacking individuals:** Critique systems and ideas, not specific people (except public figures with documented actions)
❌ **Losing hope:** Even difficult truths should end with possibility

## Example Transformations

### Before (Cold Analysis):
"Misunderstanding surrender leads to spiritual stagnation and institutional dysfunction."

### After (Empathetic Narrative):
"Ananda felt a strange sense of peace, even righteousness. He wasn't giving up; he was surrendering. But something had changed in him. A seed had been planted, and it wasn't a good one."

---

### Before (Preachy):
"You must not give up when things get difficult."

### After (Understanding):
"Perseverance is hard. Sustained effort in the face of obstacles requires reserves of determination that most people haven't developed. The surrender trap offers a shortcut: all the spiritual prestige of advanced practice without any of the actual difficulty."

## Final Note

This style guide exists to serve truth-telling with compassion. When in doubt, ask: "Does this help the reader understand themselves with clarity and kindness? Does this illuminate a path forward?" If yes, you're on track.

Write as if addressing a younger version of yourself—someone who could make (or has made) these same mistakes, who deserves both truth and grace.

## Others
Do not use em dashes.
Do not make cliches or AI sounding sections like, Why this matters.
Do not always force yourself to follow the same named structure. Be creative and unusual. Be provocative but detached.
If you use verses, quote from Srila Prabhupada's books not other versions.Bhagavad Gita 1972 and Srimad Bhagavatam.
